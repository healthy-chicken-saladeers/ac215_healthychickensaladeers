To install pipenv, Docker, Python, and Git on a virtual machine instance on Google Cloud, we followed the steps below:

### Step 1: Access the VM Instance

Open the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the "Compute Engine" section, and find your instance. Connect to your instance using SSH either via the web-based SSH client provided by Google Cloud or through your local terminal using `gcloud compute ssh`.

### Step 2: Update the Package Index

Before installing new packages, it's always good to update the package index. Run the following command:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

### Step 3: Install Python and pip

To install Python and pip, run the following command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y
```

### Step 4: Install pipenv

After installing pip, you can install pipenv as follows:

```sh
pip3 install pipenv
```

We found that pipenv installed in a location not on the environment's PATH.

It was installed in `~/.local/bin` so we added it to the `~/.bashrc` file using `nano`:

```sh
nano ~/.bashrc
```

And adding this line to the end of the `.bashrc` file:

```sh
export PATH="$PATH:~/.local/bin"
```

Then applying the changes:

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```


### Step 5: Install Git

To install Git, run the following command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install git -y
```

### Step 6: Install Docker

To install Docker, you can follow the official installation instructions or run the following convenience script:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

### Step 7: Add your user to the Docker Group (Optional)

If you want to run Docker commands as a non-root user, you need to add your user to the docker group:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

After running this command, you will need to log out and log back in, or you can restart the VM instance for the changes to take effect.

### Step 8: Verify Installation

Once everything is installed, you should verify the installations:

- For Python:

    ```sh
    python3 --version
    ```

- For pip:

    ```sh
    pip3 --version
    ```

- For pipenv:

    ```sh
    pipenv --version
    ```

- For Git:

    ```sh
    git --version
    ```

- For Docker:

    ```sh
    docker --version
    ```

This should show that pipenv, Docker, Python, and Git are installed on the Google Cloud VM instance.
