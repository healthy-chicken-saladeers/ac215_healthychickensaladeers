    "# RAG with Weaviate Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a working process we've developed for RAG. It's not intended to be ready for production, but instead as the source of production code. It describes a web scraper designed to scrape websites based on their `sitemap.xml`. For every page scraped, a CSV file is generated containing the scraped content. The filename of the CSV embeds the website address (e.g., `www.apple.com`) and a timestamp indicating when the scraping took place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that there's a length constraint on the documents (e.g., a limit of 500 words), the schema is designed to handle segmented portions of the scraped text, termed as \"text chunks\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## CSV Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each CSV file has the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filename**: `{websiteAddress}_{timestamp}.csv`\n",
    "- **Columns**:\n",
    "  - **key**: An identifier for the text chunk, typically indicating the webpage (e.g., `https://www.apple.com/iphone/`).\n",
    "  - **text**: The content of the text chunk, representing a segment of the webpage's content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Schema Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data structure is the `TextChunk` class, representing a portion of text scraped from a webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TextChunk\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description**: A segmented portion of text from a scraped webpage with full details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **key** (`string`): The identifier for the text chunk. It's generated based on the specific webpage URL and the chunk number, e.g., `{data['key']}_chunk_{i}`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **text** (`string`): The content of the text chunk. Given the constraints on document length, this content may represent only a segment of the full webpage's text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pageURL** (`string`): The specific URL of the scraped webpage this chunk originates from.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **websiteAddress** (`string`): The root address of the website from which this chunk was scraped.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **timestamp** (`date`): The date and time indicating when this chunk was scraped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TextChunk` class utilizes the `text2vec-openai` vectorizer with a module configuration set for `gpt-3.5-turbo` from OpenAI. The class is also set up with an inverted index configuration to index timestamps."

    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems such as the one we're creating, combine the power of large-scale transformers with external retrieval or database mechanisms. They allow for real-time fetching of relevant external context, which is then used to assist in generating the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can't give an LLM the entire set of information we have to answer a question, we have to split it into chunks of text. For a model like GPT-3.5 with a maximum context size of 4096 tokens, this translates to about a maximum context size of 3000 words. However, we also have to account for the response of the model, as the maximum context includes the size of the completion as well. Therefore realistically, we should keep our total number of words less than 2000. The means that $n_{chunks}$ x $size_{chunk}$ needs to be less than 2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a trade-off between text chunk size and the number of chunks, there are a few key points to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Granularity\n",
    "   - **Chunk Size**: Larger chunks provide more context in each retrieval, which can be beneficial if the answer to a question is spread out or requires understanding a broader context.\n",
    "   - **Number of Chunks**: Retrieving a higher number of smaller chunks can be beneficial if the information is quite specific and located in smaller, discrete portions of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval Speed and Efficiency\n",
    "   - **Chunk Size**: Larger chunks might slow down the retrieval process as they require more time to be fetched and processed.\n",
    "   - **Number of Chunks**: If you retrieve a large number of chunks, it can also slow down the retrieval process, especially if the underlying database/retrieval mechanism isn't optimized for high-throughput, low-latency operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Complexity and Computational Overhead\n",
    "   - **Chunk Size**: Larger chunks mean that the model has to process more data at once, increasing the computational overhead and potentially leading to a higher risk of missing key details.\n",
    "   - **Number of Chunks**: While processing multiple smaller chunks might seem computationally more manageable, combining and cross-referencing information across chunks can introduce its own complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Limitations\n",
    "   - Both larger chunk sizes and a higher number of chunks can be constrained by memory limitations, especially when dealing with models that have a fixed context window size (like the 4096 tokens limit in GPT-3.5). If a chunk or the combined set of chunks exceeds this limit, it can lead to truncation or omission of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Noise vs. Signal\n",
    "   - **Chunk Size**: Larger chunks might bring in more noise along with the relevant signal, especially if only a small portion of the chunk is relevant to the query at hand.\n",
    "   - **Number of Chunks**: Fetching more chunks increases the likelihood of retrieving relevant pieces of information, but it might also introduce more noise, making it harder for the model to focus on the most pertinent details."

jurassic-1 models remain available until june 21st, 2023, after which they will be deprecated in favor of jurassic-2. what is the difference between training and usage rates for fine-tuned models? custom models cost the same to use as pre-trained foundation models. however, training a custom model requires a one-time fee. the cost is dependent on the selected model, and is calculated by the size of the dataset, measured in megabytes, multiplied by training duration, measured in epochs (each epoch is one complete run of the entire training dataset). what is an epoch, and how many epochs are required to train a custom model? when training a custom model, an epoch is defined as one pass of the entire training dataset. typically, models are trained for 5-20 epochs, though finding the optimum number of epochs may require experimentation. how can i track my usage and spending? to track usage, log in and navigate to 'account,' then click 'model usage'. this page shows a detailed view of your organization's usage for the current billing period. to see your future expected payment and previously paid invoices, navigate to 'account', and then click 'billing & plans'. when does the billing cycle begin? usage is billed monthly, starting on the date you upgraded to a paid plan. each month, the billing cycle is the same. on the day you upgrade, your usage for the month will be billed, and then the next month's billing cycle will start on the same date. this will continue on a monthly basis until you switch plans or cancel your subscription. who is eligible for the volume discount?

       "  'text': \"pmi-masking publications pmi-masking we present a masking strategy that makes bidirectional masked-lm training more educating. in a nutshell in recent work described by an iclr 2021 spotlight paper , we show how to replace bertâ\\x80\\x99s random input masking strategy during pretraining with pmi-masking, which jointly masks neighboring tokens if they exhibit high correlation over the pretraining corpus. by preventing the model from focusing on shallow local signals, pmi-masking achieves better representations at a fraction of the training budget. despite altering only the input masking strategy, pmi-masking achieves the same bert pretraining quality in one sixth the time and achieves significantly better pretraining within the same training budget. â\\x80\\x8d masking: bertâ\\x80\\x99s added degree of freedom before bert, neural language models (lms) tended to be autoregressive, learning to predict each input token given preceding text. the masked language model (mlm) training objective of bert, for which the model learns to predict a masked subset of the input tokens, creates an inherently bidirectional representation of text. but this bidirectionality comes with an added degree of freedom relative to classical autoregressive lms: choosing which tokens to mask and which to show. our paper highlights that not all bidirectional dependencies are equal: we show that the strategy for choosing which tokens to mask and which to show can profoundly impact an mlmâ\\x80\\x99s performance. specifically, we show that the standard practice of random uniform masking often allows an mlm to minimize its training objective by latching onto shallow local signals, leading to pretraining inefficiency and suboptimal downstream performance. by limiting the modelâ\\x80\\x99s ability to rely on such shortcuts, we obtain the same pretraining performance more quickly and better performance within a fixed training budget. â\\x80\\x8d pmi-masking speed-up and improvement relatively to existing approaches on race. a motivating example to see the potential harm of local signals, we offer a simple, motivating example of neighboring tokens that are highly correlated with each other: part-of-word tokens that make up the same word. recall that bert represents text as a sequence of tokens, where each token is either a word or a part-of-word; e.g., â\\x80\\x9cchairâ\\x80\\x9d might constitute a single token while rarer words like â\\x80\\x9ceigenvalueâ\\x80\\x9d do not make it into bertâ\\x80\\x99s vocabulary and are broken up into several part-of-word tokens (â\\x80\\x9ce-igen-val-ueâ\\x80\\x9d). â\\x80\\x8d when using bertâ\\x80\\x99s regular vocabulary size of 30k tokens, the vast majority of encountered words are represented by single tokens (words are represented via ~1.1 tokens on average). however, when we artificially decrease the vocabulary size to 10k and then to 2k tokens, along the x axis of the following plot, part-of-word tokens become much more common (up to ~2 tokens-per-word on average). â\\x80\\x8d the blue curve in the above figure shows that when applying bertâ\\x80\\x99s strategy of choosing 15% of the tokens for masking uniformly at random, the model's performance is severely degraded as part-of-word tokens become prevalent. thus, by controlling the number of highly correlated tokens, we demonstrate that strong dependencies between neighboring input tokens can harm the modelâ\\x80\\x99s ability to learn from broader context. in the presence of such dependencies, the mlmâ\\x80\\x99s objective can often be minimized simply by considering immediate neighbors of the masked token (consider the easy task â\\x80\\x9ce-igen-[mask]-ueâ\\x80\\x9d). the red curve in the above figure shows that the degradation is substantially attenuated when local cues are occluded. this is done by applying whole word masking, a popular masking strategy which jointly occludes all part-of-word tokens comprising a word. our pmi-masking strategy, presented below, extends this solution to a much more prevalent class of highly correlated tokens: correlated word n-grams. â correlated word n-grams the above example of part-of-word tokens illustrated a flaw in bertâ\\x80\\x99s vanilla random masking approach, and the same issue occurs for correlated word n-grams, a class of correlated tokens that is harder to identify but affects any word level vocabulary. examples include phrases and multi-word expressions such as â\\x80\\x9ceditor in chiefâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cat onceâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9ccarbon footprintâ\\x80\\x9d, and so on. more broadly, many words provide a hint regarding the identity of their neighbors, and such shallow cues can be used by the model to minimize its objective while putting less emphasis on broader context. previous work has proposed masking strategies that can mitigate the effect of such local cues. notably, sun et al. (2019) proposed knowledge masking, which jointly masks tokens comprising entities and phrases, as identified by external parsers. the restriction to specific types of correlated n-grams, along with the reliance on imperfect tools for their identification, has limited the gains of this approach. with a similar motivation in mind, spanbert of joshi et al. (2020) introduced random-span masking, which masks word spans of lengths sampled from a geometric distribution at random positions in the text. random-span masking was shown to consistently outperform knowledge masking, however, with high probability the selected spans break up correlated n-grams, such that the prediction task can often be performed by relying on local cues. we offer a principled approach to masking spans that consistently provide high signal, unifying the intuitions behind the above approaches while also outperforming them. in order to identify highly correlated word n-grams, we rely on the measure of pointwise mutual information (pmi), which quantifies how surprising a bigram w1w2 is, given the unigram probabilities of w1 and w2 in the corpus. formally, given two tokens w1 and w2, the pmi of the bigram w1w2 is: â\\x80\\x8d where the probability of an n-gram p(w1... wn) is computed by the number of its occurrences in the corpus divided by the number of all n-grams in the corpus. pmi is a good indicator of correlation between words comprising a bigram, but extending it to measure correlation between words comprising longer n-grams is nontrivial. we propose the following extension of pmi to longer n-grams, and show that it provides a better signal than existing alternatives: where seg(w1... wn) is the set of all contiguous segmentations of the n-gram w1... wn (excluding the identity segmentation), and where any segmentation ï\\x83 â\\x88\\x88 seg(w1... wn) is composed of sub-spans that together give w1... wn. intuitively, this measure discards the contribution of high pmi subsegments of the considered n-gram; the minimum in the equation above implies that an n-gram's score is given by its weakest link, i.e., by the segmentation that comes closest to separability. this way, trigrams such as â\\x80\\x9ckuala lumpur isâ\\x80\\x9d are deranked, since despite the bigram â\\x80\\x9ckuala lumpurâ\\x80\\x9d having high pmi it is not highly correlated with the word â\\x80\\x9cisâ\\x80\\x9d, whereas â\\x80\\x9ceditor in chiefâ\\x80\\x9d, which cannot be broken to uncorrelated subsegments, is promoted for joint masking. experiments by jointly masking n-grams with high pmin scores, we speed up and improve bertâ\\x80\\x99s pretraining. when training models with either bertâ\\x80\\x99s vanilla random-token masking, spanbertâ\\x80\\x99s random-span masking or pmi-masking, in bertâ\\x80\\x99s original training setup (see details in paper), we get the following 1 to 2 point advantage in prominent benchmarks: when comparing to prominent released models of the same size (see table at the top of this post), we see that: pmi-masking outperforms a parallel approach of integrating word n-grams as tokens (pmi-masking vs. ambert). pmi-masking retains its advantage over random-span masking when training continues for 2.4 times longer than bertâ\\x80\\x99s original training (pmi-masking vs. spanbert). pmi-masking reaches the performance attained by vanilla random-token masking after â\\x85\\x99 of the training time (pmi-masking vs. roberta). 1 â\\xa0sun et al.

       "  'text': 'sensebert: driving some sense into bert publications sensebert: driving some sense into bert we enrich the self-supervision strategy employed in bert by applying self-supervision on the word-sense level. our model, sensebert, achieves significantly improved lexical disambiguation abilities, setting state-of-the-art results on the word in context (wic) task. read the paper presented at acl 2020 self-supervision for pre-trained language models the use of self-supervision has allowed neural language models to advance the frontier in natural language understanding. specifically, the self-supervision strategy employed in bert, which involves masking some of the words in an input sentence and training the model to predict them given their context, results in a versatile language model suited for many tasks. nevertheless, existing self-supervision methods operate on the word-form level, and as such, they are inherently limited. take the word â\\x80\\x98bassâ\\x80\\x99 as an example: in one context it can refer to a fish, in a second to a guitar, in the third to a type of singer, and so on. the word itself is merely a surrogate of its actual meaning in a given context - referred to as its sense . word-sense predictions made by sensebert on a raw input text. the word \"bass\" maps to its different supersenses according to context. sensebert - pre-training on word senses we propose a method to employ self-supervision directly at the word sense level. our model, named sensebert , is pre-trained to predict not only the masked words (as in bert) but also their wordnet supersenses. bertâ\\x80\\x99s current word-form level objective leads to what is commonly referred to as a language model: the model predicts words for the given masked position in a sentence. our added task allows sensebert to gather word-sense level statistics and thereby we effectively train a semantic-level language model that predicts the missing wordâ\\x80\\x99s meaning jointly with the standard word-form level prediction. self-supervision allows neural language models to learn from massive amounts of unannotated text. in order to enjoy this advantage at the lexical-semantic level, we make use of wordnet - an expert-constructed ontology that provides an inventory of word senses. we focus on a coarse-grained variant of word senses, referred to as supersenses, divided into 45 types that semantically categorize the entire language. â\\x80\\x8b labeling of words with a single supersense, for example the word â\\x80\\x98swordâ\\x80\\x99 which has only the supersense â\\x80\\x98artifactâ\\x80\\x99, is straightforward: we train the network to predict this supersense given the masked wordâ\\x80\\x99s context. as for words with multiple supersenses (like the word â\\x80\\x98bassâ\\x80\\x99 we discussed earlier), we train the model to predict any of these senses, leading to a simple yet effective labeling scheme. â\\x80\\x8b other than our additional pre-training task and the architecture changes that support it, we followed the architecture and training methods published in the bert paper. specifically, we trained models in two sizes, similar to bert model sizes - sensebertbase and sensebertlarge. our results below show significantly enhanced word meaning understanding abilities of sensebert, achieved without human annotation. word-sense predictions made by sensebert on the masked word in the sentence. results â\\x80\\x8bâ\\x80\\x8b in order to test our modelâ\\x80\\x99s lexical semantic abilities, we compared it with bert on two tasks: â\\x80\\x8b 1. â\\xa0semeval word superense disambiguation we constructed a supersense variant of the semeval-based wsd task, where the goal is to predict a wordâ\\x80\\x99s supersense given context. we trained and tested in two different schemes: a â\\x80\\x9cfrozenâ\\x80\\x9d model with a linear classifier on top (to explore the sense information captured in the modelâ\\x80\\x99s pre-trained embeddings). a â\\x80\\x9cfine-tunedâ\\x80\\x9d model, where the network weights have been modified during training. sensebertbase outscores both bertbase and bertlarge models by a large margin in both cases, and sensebertlarge yields even higher results. â â\\x80\\x8b 2. â\\xa0word in context (wic) â\\x80\\x8b the word in context (wic) task, from the superglue benchmark, is the task of predicting whether a word has the same meaning in two given sentences. this task heavily depends on word-supersense awareness. sensebertbase surpasses bertlarge, and a single sensebertlarge model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task with a score of 72.14. â â\\x80\\x8d about the author ori ram, yoav levine, itay dalmedigos, dor muhlgay, amnon shashua, kevin leyton-brown, yoav shoham lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. suspendisse varius enim in eros elementum tristique. duis cursus, mi quis viverra ornare, eros dolor interdum nulla, ut commodo diam libero vitae erat. aenean faucibus nibh et justo cursus id rutrum lorem imperdiet. nunc ut sem vitae risus tristique posuere. enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21 labs. thank you! your submission has been received! oops! something went wrong while submitting the form.',\n",

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella?

customer support is more challenging than ever before. customers expect fast, comprehensive solutions to increasingly complex issues, putting immense pressure on support teams. yet sifting through vast knowledge bases to find relevant answers is inefficient and wastes precious time.â ai21 labs has identified gaps where generative ai can create fast, tangible impact for businesses, starting with their customer support teams. â\\x80\\x98contextual answersâ\\x80\\x99 is an ai system based on question-answering technology that allows support agents to search their companyâ\\x80\\x99s extensive knowledge bases to rapidly provide customers with accurate, personalized solutions. it can help businesses boost agent productivity, reduce handling times, and increase their first-call resolution rates â\\x80\\x93 all the while enhancing customer satisfaction. this article will explore how contextual answers integrates into existing workflows to boost productivity. youâ\\x80\\x99ll learn how it empowers support teams to deliver the responsive, satisfying experiences customers demand in today's highly competitive landscape. the growing pains of customer support studies show that increasing customer retention by just 5% can boost profits by 25%-95%. and the number of repurchases and renewals also increases by 82% when the customer receives excellent and prompt service. despite the fact that high-quality customer service boosts profits and loyalty, achieving it is a formidable challenge. â\\x80\\x8d costs one major pain point is the substantial cost of staffing large, round-the-clock support teams to meet today's expectations of instant, reliable responses. even then, delivering personalized, researched answers quickly strains resources. effectivenessâ even large teams struggle resolving queries quickly and correctly. inquiries often require extensive research and tailored responses, lengthening wait times and frustrating customers. self-serviceâ despite readily available website information, users often escalate straightforward questions to agents. this overburdens staff and disappoints customers. improving accessibility is key for satisfaction and efficiency. using contextual answers to overcome support challenges what is â\\x80\\x98contextual answersâ\\x80\\x99? contextual answers is a task-specific generative ai system, based on large language models (llms), to provide accurate responses to questions based on a company's data. it lets users ask natural language questions and receives answers grounded in uploaded documents and information fed into the llm. this prevents fabricated responses common with ai, known as ai hallucinations. at ai21 labs, we have built a comprehensive end-to-end api solution which allows companies to effortlessly upload their required documents and allow their employees or customers to ask inquiries using natural language. the responses provided rely solely on the inputted information. in addition, the contextual answers tool provides a reference to the source which the answer was taken from, ensuring an unparalleled level of credibility. how contextual answers can improve customer support there are two main ways to use contextual answers for customer support: improve efficiency the contextual answers system gives customer support agents quick access to relevant information. this makes it faster for them to find answers when customers ask questions, as it significantly cuts down research time. this results in shorter wait times for customers â\\x80\\x93 a significant metric for customer satisfaction. automate responses the contextual answers system can be built into the company's website as a dynamic chatbot or refined search bar. this lets it directly answer common customer questions instantly and accurately. the company then doesn't need to handle questions already answered on its site. this focuses support efforts on complex issues and improves team efficiency. companies can use one or both approaches. but the contextual answers system reduces the need for large support teams either way, while improving customer satisfaction. the ultimate outcome includes a two-fold benefit: a significant reduction in costs of support representatives, along with an elevation in company profits, as a result of the ongoing retention of satisfied customers. how to implement contextual answers in your company 1. make a planâ the first step is to make a plan for what you want to achieve. decide if contextual answers will be used internally, externally, or both. at this point your company will also need to choose an llm provider, exploring factors such as price, the latency of the llms, the throughput (how many questions per user), api quality and ease of use. youâ\\x80\\x99ll also have to decide if you need multiple languages. if so, youâ\\x80\\x99ll need to add a translation step to the process, and pick which languages to include. for example, an online bank approached us with the need to improve their customer support. being primarily online, one of their main features is having available support 24/7, and contextual answers was a perfect fit for this use case. during the initial planning phase, this digital bank determined that, for their specific use case, an externally-facing customer solution best suited their needs. a user-friendly chatbot was developed to respond to facilitate customer inquiries and provide relevant answers. fast, reliable responses grounded in the companyâ\\x80\\x99s data were the priority. it was equally important for them to maintain consistency in tone, format, and response length during customer interactions. they also included a translation component into the process, recognizing the multilingual nature of their clientele. during the planning phase, these decisions were used as guides to streamline our processes and align them with the bank's specifications. 2. curate and label the data once your company has its plan in place, relevant data must be compiled and curated. if the system is for external use, and customers will be interacting with it, the required data should also be publicly available to customers. for internal use by the support team, the company can also incorporate non-public policies and guidelines. after the data has been collected, it needs to be labeled accordingly.â for instance, a saas company might have premium, gold, and platinum tiers of customers. these tiers use different product features and need different answers to their questions. itâ\\x80\\x99s important for the company to tag each data item with the tier to which it belongs in order to provide the right answers. so when a customer asks a question, contextual answers will know which data to extract the information from, and customers will get answers that match their product features and tier. you can even go further, and personalize the answer according to the customer's profile, giving them a customized and accurate response. in the case of the digital bank that we worked with, they created a database of extensive support documents that included all of the information that they were authorized to provide to their customers. this database was the llmâ\\x80\\x99s single source of truth. it was the context used to answer customer questions, and unanswerable questions were escalated to human representatives. they also aggregated previously asked questions with ideal responses to refine answer formats. this shows how thoughtful data gathering, organization and labeling ensures contextual answers has the appropriate contextual information to deliver precise, personalized responses. this strengthens accuracy while mirroring company guidelines. 3. develop & deploy contextual answers in order for contextual answers to work, the company must synchronize the relevant, curated documents with their chosen ai21 large language model. at this stage, the llm provider will meticulously customize the contextual answers tool to precisely meet the company's needs. when using contextual answers for customer support, a company can adjust the tone of communication based on individual customer profiles. a customer who is older may need a more sophisticated response, while someone who is younger may need a more casual response. as well as extracting personalized information, the llm can extract answers from distinct document sets for each query. additionally, for a retail company, contextual answers can pull from different product manuals and catalogs to find answers based on what the customer purchased. by customizing which documents are searched, it provides responses tailored to each customer's specific items. once the product is developed to meet the company's specifications, it is deployed into their operational framework. in the case of the digital bank refined ai chatbot, seamless integration within the bank's application was executed to guarantee constant accessibility for the users. whether you need to deploy a solution locally or globally, ai21 labs offers an easy plug-and-play option. 4. continuous evaluation in this final phase of the process, it remains vital to maintain a continuous evaluation of the contextual answersâ\\x80\\x99â\\xa0 performance. thoroughly checking the user experience, whether for employees, customers, or both. an essential component of this evaluation involves validating the accuracy of the generated answers, and ensuring their precision. ongoing monitoring of key metrics is also important. this includes an in-depth analysis of key performance indicators, such as customer satisfaction metrics, retention rates, cost efficiencies, and revenue maximization. this comprehensive evaluation framework provides insights into the extent to which contextual answers genuinely contributes to the company's expansion trajectory, while also revealing opportunities for improvement. in the case of the digital bank, we created a grading system that ranked each chatbot answer from 1-5, whereas 1 was unacceptable, and 5 was ideal. this training ensured acceptable responses aligned with the bankâ\\x80\\x99s requirements. the bank will need to continue scoring its chatbot answers to maintain quality. as a result of maintaining the chatbot's high quality, the bank has seen some positive results, including better customer satisfaction and a smaller customer support team, which reduces costs. conclusion as customers demand ever-faster and more personalized support, contextual answers represents a powerful opportunity. this ai-powered solution streamlines workflows while automating repetitive tasks. support agents can rapidly address inquiries by tapping into collective knowledge. meanwhile, self-service options reassure customers their needs are heard. for organizations seeking to strengthen support and boost loyalty, contextual answers is a strategic investment. don't leave gains on the table â\\x80\\x93 contact our experts today to explore how contextual answers can help your business thrive. about the author enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and

exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

       "  'text': \"the complete guide to llm product development blog posts the complete guide to llm product development in this guide, we breakdown the large language model (llm) product development process. you'll learn all the necessary stages of developing an llm-based product, including planning, execution, and monitoring.â the current buzz around generative ai is overwhelming. the potential it holds is exciting, promising to revolutionize industries and redefine user experiences. however,â\\xa0successful implementation of generative ai requires a strategic approach, an understanding of the process, and a clear roadmap to navigate the complexities involved. at ai21 labs, we've developed large language model (llm) solutions for top enterprises like ubisoft, clarivate and carrefour. our custom development process generates predictable results and revenues for our clientsâ\\xa0(to learn more about this, feel free to contact us ). let's break down this process into its basic stages, which require meticulous planning, precise execution, and vigilant monitoring.â 1. preparation: plan your llm development project like any successful project, an llm development project needs to be thoroughly thought through, and well planned. the preparation stage is dedicated to mapping out the project's overarching objectives and outlining the details of the strategic plan.â the goal of this stage this phase can either be undertaken independently, by the company wanting to build the product, or in collaboration with the llm provider it decides to work with. during this stage of the process, it is important to collect the necessary resources, including the relevant data which will be used as context input, or as a dataset for an llm training process. some data may not be accessible to third party vendors, such as the llm provider. it is therefore crucial to overcome these limitations at this stage. for example, letâ\\x80\\x99s take an ecommerce company that wants to create a tool that generates product descriptions for their website, based on a short list of product features. at this stage of the process, they should collect data such as a content style guide and a list of characteristics of each of their products and already existing product descriptions, which will be used as context input and output for the llm during the training process. if, for instance, the company is unable to share some of this information with a third party vendor, perhaps becauseâ\\xa0they are coming out with a new product whose details are still confidential, they should consider this issue at this stage, and seek a reasonable solution.â identifying stakeholdersâ stakeholders include strategic decision makers such as ceos, ctos and product managers. a product manager is usually a key player in this strategic phase, since they are well versed in both technical and business aspects. additionally, the people who will ultimately implement the solution must also be involved, in order to contribute their technical and practical expertise. these include data scientists, data engineers, software engineers, devops, and designers.â furthermore, the legal and compliance team should be involved to address privacy concerns, in addition to business analysts and domain experts to assist in making the most informed strategic decisions. 2. building the product once the preparation stage has been finalized, and the required results have been mapped out, it is time to build the model. the goal of this stage during this stage, the company's goal is to implement all of the plans made in the preparation stage, to reach the desired outcome; namely, for the llm model to accept a certain input and retrieve an appropriate output. tasks to be completed at this stage 1. choosing a language model: this will be done with the help of the llm provider. there are a number of different factors to consider based on the specific use case. these factors include cost, performance and the modelâ\\x80\\x99s ability to handle the use case complexity.â 2. defining the user flow and wireframes: this phase entails outlining the user's interface with the tool being built, alongside determining the anticipated user-input data, its format, and the desired output. this step, if done correctly, will save a lot of time when developing and building your product. 3. data curation: this involves curating and preparing the necessary data for the specific use case. this can include examples of different types of inputs that the various components of the llm will be provided with, as well as examples of desired outputs. this data will be used toâ\\xa0test the model's outputs at the model evaluation stage. if data security issues have not been solved yet, this is the time to determine which data can be shared, and find solutions to any data privacy issues.â 4. training / prompt engineering: this is a crucial task in which the company customizes the language model to fit their specific needs.â this can be done using one of two methods, or a combination of both.â the first is to further train the language model by feeding it examples of inputs and expected outputs. this allows us to learn the intricacies of specific language patterns. the second is prompt engineering. this involves crafting well-defined input queries, instructions, or context for a language model to provide accurate and relevant responses, optimizing its expected outputs for specific tasks or applications. 5. model adjustments (parameters): adjust the parameters to optimize response quality according to your specific needs. this step refines the model's ability to understand and produce human-like responses, aligned with your product's objectives. read more about parameters here .â 6. model evaluation: assess your model's performance against a diverse set of scenarios and benchmarks. this evaluation provides insights into its strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, ultimately guiding you towards a polished end product. 7. pre-processing and post-processing: pre-processing involves cleaning and structuring input data for the model, while post-processing polishes the model's output, ensuring it's coherent, grammatically sound, and aligned with your brand's needs. structuring prompts for scalable product descriptions with llms referring back to our example of an ecommerce company developing a product description generator, at this stage, they must determine which language model to use. in this particular case, a foundation model would be most appropriate. when aiming for automated, high-quality product descriptions, the structuring of your input prompt is pivotal. by thoughtfully designing this prompt, businesses can generate countless descriptions that are not only unique to each product but also consistently adhere to the brand's tone, style, and guidelines. here's the breakdown of the ideal three-part input structure: â\\x80\\x8d brand guidelines (constant): this section forms the backbone of every product description. by embedding your brand guidelines into the prompt, you ensure that each generated description remains faithful to your brand's voice, tone, and values. for instance, the guidelines might instruct the llm to maintain a certain tone (e.g., technical, precise), emphasize specific details, or follow a particular format. product details (variable): this is the dynamic section of the prompt, tailored for each product. by substituting placeholders such as {product name} and/or {list of features}, businesses can automate the description generation for a vast array of products. â\\x80\\x8d instruction (constant): a consistent directive informs the llm about the exact task, such as creating a one-paragraph product description. this ensures the output meets the desired format and adheres to the brand guidelines every single time. the advantage of this modular prompt structure is its scalability. once an organization has established its brand guidelines and instruction segments, it can easily slot in different product details to churn out descriptions in bulk. the constant sections (1 and 3) ensure brand consistency, while the variable section (2) ensures product specificity. this systematic approach provides a streamlined solution, ensuring both efficiency and quality in product description generation. and here's an example of what we would expect from the product description: pro tip: although many companies wish to create a completely automated system, it is important to have a human monitoring the system to ensure quality output.â 3. model deployment once satisfied with the model's demonstrated proficiency and effectiveness in producing desired outcomes, the next step involves the strategic deployment of the model onto the platform of choice.â the goal of this stage this step marks the transition from theoretical concept to real-world utility, enabling the integration of the model's capabilities into the intended environment. the overarching goal is to have the model working on the desired platform, so that the end user can utilize it.â referring back to our product description generator example, at this stage, the company will integrate the product description generator into their internal systems. this will make it accessible to the people tasked with creating product descriptions. tasks to be completed at this stage deploying an llm onto the desired platform involves a streamlined process which can be done through a number of different methods: connecting the model directly through an api, utilizing an sdk, or leveraging a cloud server. ai21 labs models are available through amazon sagemaker, amazon bedrock, and google cloud platform. this makes the models easily accessible to any company using any of those providers.â by integrating with the llm provider's api, you establish a direct communication channel between your platform and the model. this enables seamless transmission of input queries and retrieval of model-generated responses. additionally, leveraging a cloud server, such as those offered by major cloud providers, allows you to host the llm and make it accessible over the internet. this cloud-based deployment ensures scalability, enabling your platform to handle varying workloads efficiently.â pro tip: ensure that your final product undergoes a complete quality assurance (qa) and testing process before launch. 4. monitoring results the final stage of this process is to monitor the released product and analyze its performance.â the goal of this stage the main aim is to keep a close eye on the product's technical performance as well as what impact it's having on the business.â the goal is to understand how users are reacting, how much they're engaging with the product, and receive and analyze their feedback. this is also the time to improve, expand, or grow the product. if the results aren't as expected, this is the time to examine what is and isnâ\\x80\\x99t working, and act accordingly. at this stage, the ecommerce company, as discussed in our example, should start using the generator to create product descriptions. it should also monitor results. this includes observing how users are reacting to the updated product descriptions and whether they are seeing an increase, decrease or no change in their sales. further improvements to ensure the optimal performance of a product, maintaining a consistent line of communication with the llm vendor is imperative. this ensures the seamless integration of any new models and capabilities post-product launch. in addition, it is critical to conduct periodic tests, so that any issues can be addressed promptly. in the event of any problems, early communication with the llm vendor is of paramount importance. this facilitates timely diagnosis of the problem's root cause and the development of a feasible solution. such proactive engagement with the llm vendor aligns with the philosophy of continuous improvement and ensures that the product consistently meets its intended standards. conclusion in the dynamic landscape of modern business, llm-based solutions have surged in significance. however crafting an llm-driven product requires nuanced understanding and meticulous planning. this journey encompasses careful preparation, precise model construction, strategic deployment, and vigilant monitoring. as the llm-based product evolves, continuous learning and adaptation remain essential.â to learn more

system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly. name *

challenges than regular companies.\\nthis guide offers a deep dive into common ecommerce seo challenges and how generative ai can help overcome them. when it comes to optimizing websites for seo, ecommerce businesses face even greater challenges than regular companies. these challenges include generating relevant and high-quality content at scale, optimizing traffic based on factors like seasonality and events, and generating thousands of pages that target different keywords. for executives and seo managers concerned about the overall budget and effectiveness of their seo strategy, generative ai proves to be an effective solution.â this guide offers a deep dive into common ecommerce seo challenges and how generative ai can help overcome them.â\\xa0â ecommerce seo challenges 1. producing relevant and high-quality content at scale creating quality content for an online store with a multitude of items can be challenging. it requires conducting research, writing, editing, and optimizing content, all of which takes a lot of time and energy, particularly considering the sheer number of items. moreover, as the number of products increases, maintaining consistency and uniqueness becomes more difficult, leading to potential issues, such as duplication. it takes a delicate balance of manpower, expertise, and budget to balance scale, with seo-optimized content for each product. 2. optimizing content equally crucial to content creation is the adoption of an ongoing review and optimization process of existing content. this is directed by a range of factors, including userâ\\x80\\x99s search patterns, seasonal shifts, and emerging trends. for instance, during christmas, buyers are more likely to search for keywords such as â\\x80\\x9cchristmas sweaterâ\\x80\\x9d rather than â\\x80\\x9cwinter sweater.â\\x80\\x9d therefore, when christmas approaches, ecommerce businesses need to tweak multiple listings to optimize them accordingly. regardless of how minor the changes are, implementing them across thousands of product listings is a challenging and resource-intensive task.â 3. dealing with googleâ\\x80\\x99s search generative experience (sge)â with the anticipated introduction of google\\'s search generative experience (sge), users will see new search results, featuring summary snapshots generated by google\\'s ai bot. this means that standard search results will be pushed even further down the search page, making it crucial to optimize title tags and other content.â to improve their chances of appearing in google\\'s shopping graph, ecommerce businesses will have to be aware of how the search engineâ\\x80\\x99s algorithm works, and create high-quality, accurate, and valuable product-led content accordingly. 4 ways to use generative ai in ecommerce seo with these challenges in mind, letâ\\x80\\x99s explore how generative ai can help. 1. generate various forms of content at scale ecommerce businesses can use generative ai to create different forms of content at scale. these include: product descriptions with generative ai, ecommerce businesses can automate the process of writing product descriptions at scale , helping them to rank higher in serps, which will become increasingly more challenging with the roll out of sge. the benefits of llm based product description generators, which can be tailored to each specific companyâ\\x80\\x99s needs, is that they can be trained to follow a specific format, length, and tone of voice, in order to keep all of the content consistent and in line with the brandâ\\x80\\x99s tone.â on-page seo elements generative ai can also help generate on-page seo elements at scale, including page titles, meta-descriptions, and alt-texts.â this way, ecommerce businesses can save countless hours and resources that theyâ\\x80\\x99d have otherwise had to spend doing it for each product listing individually.â faqs customers will inevitably have questions about products, delivery times, policies and more. generative ai can help produce relevant questions and answers at scale, enabling ecommerce stores to give as much information as possible to all of their users, and increase their chance of being ranked. product-led content product-led content such as blog posts, newsletters, and how-to pages can help ecommerce businesses give in-depth answers to user queries, and then direct them back to the relevant product listings.â for example, letâ\\x80\\x99s take a retail store that specializes in selling various advanced gadgets, including high-quality earphones. in this situation, the store can create a helpful \"how-to\" guide where it would explain how to fix earphones that aren\\'t working.â here too, using generative aiâ\\x80\\x99s text generation abilities, ecommerce businesses are able to produce valuable product-led content more easily and at scale.â generate content in multiple languages ai can also be used to generate content in multiple languages, whether it\\'s blog posts, user guides, product descriptions, or other types of content. pro-tip: ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99 jurassic-2 (j2) models can be integrated into your website or application to help with content generation.â\\xa0according to our internal evaluations from helm, the leading benchmark for language models, jurassic-2 ultra scores a win-rate of 86.8%, solidifying it as a leader in the llm space. furthermore, j2 models support a number of languages, including french, spanish, portuguese, german, dutch, and italian, as well as english. content optimizationâ generative ai can also serve as a significant component, not only in crafting first drafts of content such as product descriptions, blog posts, etc., but also in enhancing content optimization. when shifts occur in seasonality or user search patterns, businesses can harness the capabilities of text generation. by inputting appropriate changes which need to be made, an ai text generation tool can seamlessly produce updated content, while retaining the original structure.â 2. provide a great user experience websites that provide an excellent user experience are ranked higher by search engines.â with the help of generative ai, ecommerce businesses can implement a contextual answers solution to help answer any question customers may have.â with contextual answers, ai21 studio\\'s question answering solution, an ecommerce business can implement an automated response system on their website, which retrieves its answers from a specific library of documents, such as help center content. this response system is able to provide accurate and relevant answers based only on the content available in those libraries.â this can further help reduce customer support wait times and provide instant answers to customer queries, enhancing the overall user experience.â contextual answers can also be used internally, by the support team. if they are engaging in conversation with a user, and do not know the answer to a specific question, they can use the contextual answers solution to search for the response they need from within the companyâ\\x80\\x99s internal databases. this too can reduce wait times, and improve the customer satisfaction, further improving the users\\' experience on the website.â\\xa0â\\xa0â 3. create ai-powered toolsâ with the help of llms, ecommerce businesses can create ai-powered tools with the goal of generating traffic for them. a great example is an ai-powered birthday greeting generator for a gift shop. when a customer visits the online store, they can access this tool by clicking on a designated button. the tool will prompt users to input basic information like the recipientâ\\x80\\x99s name, relationship to the sender, age, and any specific preferences they have for the greeting (e.g., sentimental, humorous, poetic). based on the userâ\\x80\\x99s input, this tool will generate personalized birthday greetings for the recipient.â when the user purchases a gift from your online store, they can choose to send their personalized greeting card along with the gift. this ai-powered birthday greeting generator can add a special touch to the gift-giving experience, making it more memorable and heartfelt, improving the customerâ\\x80\\x99s overall experience.â similarly, ecommerce businesses can create relevant ai-powered tools for their online store, helping them deliver a memorable shopping experience. 4. implement programmatic seo programmatic seo is the method which seo experts use to generate large amounts of organic search traffic by publishing mass-produced pages that have been generated automatically or semi-automatically. through programmatic seo, a business can create thousands of pages with content that addresses simple yet repeatable key phrases on search engines. for example if you run a bookstore, by leveraging programmatic seo, your team can generate thousands of pages, each featuring a unique summary for every book. these pages can target the keyword structure - â\\x80\\x9cbook name + summaryâ\\x80\\x9d. in such cases, generative ai can also be used to summarize long documents into shorter content. ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99 summarization capabilities â\\xa0 can create accurate summary pages for different types of content, while still staying true to the original content. trip advisor is an example of successful programmatic seo. they have more than 7,00,00,000 pages indexed on google, with different sets of target keywords. their pages are so well optimized that most of these pages rank on the first page when you search for something related to hotels, places, and all-things-travel. with enough information, generative ai can help create substantial and valuable content for each page, addressing specific user queries and providing useful information. conclusion in conclusion, generative ai offers a game-changing solution to the intricate challenges of ecommerce seo. â\\xa0from generating high-quality content at scale to optimizing for evolving trends and languages, ai streamlines processes that otherwise strain resources. implementing ai-powered tools further enhances user experiences.â by integrating ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99 models, businesses can navigate these complexities, boosting seo quality and efficiency and ensuring a promising path forward for online success.

process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella.

finance industry, however when it comes to generative ai, companies are just beginning to scratch the surface. in this article, we will delve into use cases in which generative ai has the highest potential to revolutionize the finance industry. artificial intelligence is already deeply embedded in the finance industry. 85% of financial services companies already use ai in some form, with plans to integrate ai even further within the next two years. when it comes to generative ai, however, companies are just beginning to scratch the surface. the finance industry faces unique challenges in implementing generative ai, in large part due to the stringent regulatory landscape designed to protect customer data, ensure fair practices, and maintain market integrity. despite these and other challenges, forward-thinking financial companies recognize the immense potential of generative ai and are actively seeking ways to harness its transformative power. in this article, we will delve into use cases in which generative ai has the highest potential to revolutionize the finance industry by streamlining operations, enhancing customer experiences, and assisting in making data-driven decisions.â summarizing financial documents and unstructured data finance professionals working in investment banking, research departments, and asset management sales teams face the challenging and time-consuming task of reviewing and analyzing complex documents. this requires not only reading and digesting large amounts of information, but also understanding and drawing actionable conclusions from it.â a specialized summarization language model like summarize api extracts key points from one or multiple documents, while remaining true to their original source. by incorporating this model into a solution, firms can condense large amounts of information accurately and efficiently, reducing the need for financial analysts, researchers and sales teams to manually read and analyze unstructured data. it not only saves time, but also reduces human error, where the eye can misread content or miss key points when faced with an overwhelming amount of information. â\\x80\\x8d bloomberg has already started using a summarization solution to help both financial professionals and clients address the overwhelming amount of financial news, saving them a vast amount of time and allowing them to stay updated with the latest developments. extracting the right information financial analysts, asset managers, and research departments within investment and retail banks are required to extract specific information from a large corpus of financial data to promptly address customer inquiries. consequently, they find themselves diligently sifting through vast amounts of information across multiple documents, in search of the exact answers or solutions. here, a multi-doc contextual answers solution can make a huge difference. contextual answers uses a combination of nlp and machine learning to analyze the context of documents and provide rapid, accurate answers to specific queries. for example, if you want to find out if a particular action will contravene a rule included in a set of regulations, you can type in your question directly and the model will retrieve the answer from within the text, giving your answer higher levels of accuracy, and avoiding hallucinations.â one firm using a similar solution is morgan stanley . over the years, morgan stanley conducted extensive research on companies, sectors, and markets, which they compiled into a large library. they recently announced a generative ai-powered question answering solution to enable brokers to ask the library questions and receive answers in an easily digestible format. customer support today's customers expect immediate and helpful responses to their inquiries. financial companies struggle to meet these demands, as they are time-consuming and resource-intensive. generative ai emerges as a valuable tool in addressing these challenges by incorporating chatbots capable of addressing customer inquiries effectively. generative ai-driven chatbots, designed to respond with information solely based on the content contained in a company's database, ensure the delivery of reliable and rapid responses. through the strategic deployment of generative ai, financial institutions can strike a balance between operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. â\\x80\\x8d capital one has already started to experiment with using generative ai in order to automate and improve their customer service, using ai chatbots that better understand customer queries and concerns.â extracting relevant data from transcripts and other documents another important but time-consuming task that financial institutions face is extracting relevant information and conducting intent analysis from call transcripts. for example, if a customer calls a bank to make a financial trade, the bank is required, for compliance and regulatory reasons, to document the details of this call in their records in a specific format.â here too, generative ai serves as an effective tool by applying named entity recognition, which can extract specific words from unstructured data and categorize them. continuing from the previous example, gen ai can be used to extract details from a customer call, including the quantity, price, time stamp and confirmation of execution. the details would then be formatted to conform to the bank's internal compliance system. applying a similar idea, goldman sachs is running a poc to extract and classify data from the millions of legal documents they receive, and reformat them to make it understandable to their systems.â generation of legal documents forâ\\xa0 investment banksâ generative ai can also streamline and speed up the creation of proprietary legal documents for investment banks. with the implementation of advanced llms, gen ai can assist in drafting complex legal documents with precision and efficiency, tailored to the specific needs and requirements of each investment bank. ai-powered document generation significantly reduces the legal teams' workload, allowing them to focus on higher-value tasks and strategic decision-making.â conclusion generative ai is already changing the finance industry and leading companies are already finding innovative ways to use it. jp morgan , bloomberg , morgan stanley and more are already implementing gen ai to conduct sophisticated financial research, communicate efficiently with clients, and provide better customer support.â although generative ai is still in its infancy, most financial leaders are already recognizing the necessity of examining their current processes and strategizing about where ai could be integrated. otherwise, they risk falling behind.â due to the high stakes involved, integrating gen ai in the finance industry requires careful attention and collaboration with trusted software partners, as well as constant human oversight and monitoring. when implemented with care, generative ai has the potential to skyrocket productivity, revolutionize financial processes and transform the entire industry landscape. â\\x80\\x8d about the author enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21

figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google

math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel

generative ai in the retail industry will empower retailers to enhance user experiences, streamline operations and ultimately drive business growth. as generative ai continues to evolve, retailers must embrace the latest ai technology in order to stay competitive in the rapidly changing market landscape. weâ\\x80\\x99ve all seen futuristic movies where a truly personal shopping experience is delivered with the power of artificial intelligence. perhaps, like us, your first thought was the iconic scene from the movie minority report. \"hello, mr. yakamoto. welcome back to the gap! how did those assorted tank tops work out for you?\" with generative ai technology, even in its early stages, this vision is closer to reality than ever before. the adoption of ai in the retail industry will empower retailers to enhance user experiences, streamline operations and ultimately drive business growth.â as generative ai continues to evolve, retailers must embrace the latest ai technology in order to stay competitive in the rapidly changing market landscape. here are the areas within retail where we foresee that personalized ai will have the highest impact. 1. personalized product descriptionsâ in retail, product descriptions play a crucial role in selling products. it\\'s an area customers actually take the time to read in order to understand more about their potential purchase. in a recent study conducted by convercart, it was found that 87% of customers feel product content is the most important factor when deciding to purchase an item online as they cannot physically see or feel the item.â however, writing product descriptions can be time-consuming and therefore expensive. this is especially true for large companies with a vast amount of inventory. using ai, organizations can effectively streamline the process by:â creating targeted descriptions : ai can tailor product descriptions at scale to various different personas, emphasizing features that are likely to be most relevant to them. with segmented audiences in place, organizations can tailor their descriptions to be more personal according to various factors like age, geographical location, browsing history and returning or new customers.â 2. personalized customer supportâ the use of chatbots in customer support is nothing new â\\x80\\x94 however, they have always been rather impersonal and tend to stick to a very specific flow. now, with llms, organizations can drastically improve and personalize the way they connect to their customers.â here are a few examples of how ai can help customer support teams handle complaints or queries â\\x80\\x94 while also communicating to customers that they care about their needs: offer 24/7 customer support : ai systems can answer customer queries at any time of the day, providing a consistent level of support without the constraints of human working hours. support instant responses : use ai to reduce wait times and improve customer satisfaction with instant responses to customer questions.â understand context and provide answers : advanced ai algorithms can understand the context behind customer queries, enabling more relevant and personalized responses. ai can also be prompted to answer customer questions from a given database of text. â\\x80\\x8d allow for scalability : ai can handle an unlimited number of queries simultaneously, offering a scalable solution to customer support. 3. personal shopping assistantâ there\\'s nothing worse than feeling like someone is clocking your every move as you browse through a store. however, there are those times where you need help locating a specific size or color of an item. ai personal shopping assistants can seamlessly guide customers along the buying journey in the following ways:â provide personalized recommendations : ai personal shopping assistants can analyze customer behavior, preferences and past purchases to make personalized product recommendations â\\x80\\x94 providing a unique shopping experience for customers that encourages more sales.â use conversational language : ai assistants can understand and engage in human-like conversations with customers using natural language processing (nlp). this allows for a more humanized experience, enabling retail companies to build on high quality customer engagement and perception.â the future of retail is here with personalized ai recent advancements of llms and generative ai have given retailers a major leap forward in creating content. this has significantly reduced the cost of content, giving retailers the power to easily create personalized content. in order to tackle the significant challenges that the retail industry faces, retailers need to leverage the power of personalized retail with ai. your customers and your bottom line will thank you. ready to transform your online retail store? contact us to learn how you can personalize your retail

language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that\\'s it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it\\'s your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly.

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states?

while generative ai shows incredible promise, according to a recent kmpg survey , most businesses struggle to adopt it, citing cost, complexity and lack of the modelsâ\\x80\\x99 specialization in their organizational data, leading to responses that are incorrect, â\\x80\\x98hallucinatedâ\\x80\\x99 or inappropriate for the context. this can cause huge liabilities and in many instances, make generative ai completely unusable for use cases. this is why weâ\\x80\\x99ve developed contextual answers, an end-to-end api solution where answers are designed to be completely grounded in organizational knowledge and avoid hallucinations. weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing tremendous demand from businesses that wish to leverage contextual answers to supercharge organizational productivity and provide superior customer experiences.â clarivate , a leading global information services provider, partnered with us to apply contextual answers across their suite of library solutions, providing students, faculty and researchers answers to questions grounded in curated and trusted scholarly content. here are a few other examples. customer support for crms and independent software vendors : answering end user support questions using internal organization documentation, reducing the load and cost and improving customer satisfaction financial service institutions : assisting in the analysis of business documents such as financial reports, call logs, and past presentations, allowing analysts to cover more resourcesâ education service providers: allowing students, teachers, and researchers to quickly find answers in large databases full of articles, books and research papers legal services and insurance : providing the ability to quickly look up relevant legal documents, including legislation, regulations and internal compliance guidelinesâ sales and marketing : supporting sales associates by pulling information from product documents, competitor analysis, marketing materials, and sales playbooks to answer customer queries or build pitches field technicians: enabling field technicians to quickly reference manual specific questions without having to waste time searching through countless technical documents walkthrough: build a knowledge management system using contextual answers as an example, letâ\\x80\\x99s leverage these capabilities to create an efficient knowledge management system (kms) for an organization. according to a recent report from coveo , the average employee spends 3.6 hours daily searching for relevant information, including internal company policies (for example, hybrid work guidelines).â\\xa0â now with contextual answers, you can easily deploy a full question-answering system based solely on organizational data alone. by providing employees with rapid answers backed by attributed sources, businesses can dramatically increase productivity. ready to get started? step 1: upload your files you can upload your files to your library, where we offer free storage. in this example, we will upload three documents with company policies (working from abroad, hybrid work guidelines, it security).â this can be done with a simple call using our python sdk (or an http request): import ai21\\nai21.api_key = your_api_key\\nfile_id = ai21.library.files.upload(file_path=file_path) you can also do it via our studio platform: you can upload a file as it is, store it in a directory (for those who like working with directories) or add labels. this can help you organize your filing system, while focusing your questions on a subset of documents. step 2: ask a question your users can now ask a question and immediately get the answer with attribution to the relevant source. the system works as follows: the question is used as a query for a retrieval mechanism, which searches over the entire knowledge base and retrieves the most relevant contexts. with rapid changes occurring in work environments lately, a common question from employees is about working remotely: response = ai21.library.answer.execute(question=\"how many days can i work from home?\") the response will be: two days a week note that the full response returned from the model also contains the sources used as context (see â\\x80\\x9c sources â\\x80\\x9d field). however, if the answer to the question is not in any of the documents, the model will indicate that by returning an empty response. for instance, if we will ask the following question: response = ai21.library.answer.execute(question=\"what\\'s my meal allowance when working from home?\") the response will indicate that the answer is not found in any of the documents within your library. you can also do it via our studio platform: if you have a large collection of documents or have your own retrieval mechanism, you may want to ask a question on a subset of your knowledge base.â learn more on how to refine answer retrieval here . about the author yuval belfer talia wissner-levy enjoyed this?

retail and ecommerce industries in 2023, and how companies in these sectors can apply generative ai to scale operations, drive more sales, automate workflows, boost productivity and gain an advantage in an increasingly competitive landscape.â although generative ai is at its early stages, its potential to disrupt industries across the board has already become apparent. many industries are already experimenting and beginning to innovate with this technology, including the retail industry, which is showing incredible promise for growth fueled by generative ai. letâ\\x80\\x99s explore some of the ways weâ\\x80\\x99ve already seen generative ai benefit retailers, as well as some high-potential opportunities for future exploration. product descriptionsâ 82% of shoppers feel product descriptions are extremely or very influential to their purchasing decisions, according to a study by fieldagent .â however, writing and managing effective product descriptions takes a great deal of time, effort and money, especially for large brands selling thousands of products.â using ai to improve descriptions large language models (llms) can be used to generate product descriptions, titles and taglines that incorporate the productâ\\x80\\x99s attributes, the style of description, the brandâ\\x80\\x99s unique voice, and more.â by filling in a few simple details, such as the name of the product and its main features, the writer is able to generate the first draft of a product description with the click of a button.â see example below:â the generated description: the product description can also be customized according to length, style and tone of voice, so that each product description is generated in a consistent format, and speaks the same language.â genai can also create new, or adjust existing, product descriptions at scale, making them more relevant in terms of seasonality or upcoming holidays and events. this is especially helpful for seo purposes.â for example, let\\'s consider a product description for a sweater. the original description may look something like: \"stay warm and stylish with our cozy women\\'s sweater, made from high-quality materials. perfect for any occasion.\" generative ai can make this more relevant for the upcoming holiday season by writing something like: \"embrace the holiday spirit with our cozy sweater. whether you\\'re attending a family gathering or enjoying a winter stroll, this sweater is the perfect blend of comfort and holiday charm.\" this entire process frees up writersâ\\x80\\x99 time, allowing them to focus on more complex, creative and high-value work, best suited to their skill sets, with the end result being acceleration of time to market.â customer supportâ as an ecommerce brand grows, so does its need to give a higher level of customer service.â customers expect instant, professional and personal online and phone support, which is a costly expenditure for companies, and is challenging to scale.â using ai to improve support efficiency reduce costs using large language models, retail organizations can instantly respond to customer inquiries online, using pre-existing information such as documentation, policies, faqs and knowledge base articles. this can also help to personalize the customerâ\\x80\\x99s experience, and allow them to have a human-like conversation, and get answers to their specific questions.â in addition, companies can incorporate an â\\x80\\x9cask me anythingâ\\x80\\x9d search bar, which can provide contextual answers on return and exchange policies, and present customers with relevant information available on the website. this provides a seamless customer experience, making it easier, more accessible and personalized for each customerâ\\x80\\x99s requirements. for example, if someone wants to know how long the standard delivery time is, they can simply type their question in the search bar and receive a clear and concise answer, without reading any other irrelevant information. with generative ai, customers become more self-sufficient, improving their experience and satisfaction, while saving businesses time and money. review analysis manual review reading and classification play a crucial role in helping businesses identify successes, failures, upcoming trends, and potential market changes. however, this is a time consuming task, which can be extremely burdensome for brands. using ai to streamline the review analysis process llms have the ability to process information from each review. they can track sentiment analysis, which determines the emotional tone behind the text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral, providing real-time, accurateâ\\xa0 insights into reviews.â â\\xa0llms also allow for multi-dimensional classification, meaning they can extract and classify various aspects mentioned in each review, enabling comprehensive categorization and analysis. this multifaceted approach allows brands to gain a deeper understanding of specific aspects of their products or services that are being praised or criticized by customers. this ultimately enables more accurate and efficient insights into customer reviews, providing brands with real-time feedback that can be acted upon quickly. for example, letâ\\x80\\x99s take a look at this review of bed sheets: this is not a completely straightforward review, because it discusses the high quality of the sheets, while also conveying the disappointment because of a misleading product description. a llm will be able to classify both aspects of the review, and categorize them accordingly so that none of the information gets lost.â start your ai retail journey artificial intelligence (ai) is becoming an essential tool for the retail and ecommerce industries, helping to boost productivity and gain a competitive edge, and we are already working with major players to actualize the vast opportunities that exist for these sectors.â the use of large language models, like those offered by ai21 labs, can provide retailers with the ability to automate repetitive tasks, offer a high level of personalized customer support, and produce high-quality content that resonates with their target audience. with the continued development and adoption of ai in the retail industry, we can expect to see even more innovation and optimization in the near future. about the

transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that\\'s it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it\\'s your turn. a mrkl system such as

       "  'text': \"simplifying our jurassic-2 offering announcements simplifying our jurassic-2 offering we are streamlining our offering from five foundation models to three, all including both instruct and few-shot capabilities. our foundation models are renamed to ultra, mid and light in order to reflect the relative size and capabilities of each model.â three months ago, we announced an exciting milestone for ai21 labs - the launch of jurassic-2 (j2), our next generation foundation models. these models include instruct capabilities, allowing them to be steered with natural language instruction, also known as zero-shot instruction-following. â\\x80\\x8d what weâ\\x80\\x99ve learned: weâ\\x80\\x99ve spent the last three months gathering user feedback, and as always, are constantly on the lookout for new ways to improve our technology, as well as ease of use for our customers. the most common issue weâ\\x80\\x99ve found that our users face is deciding which language model they need for their specific use case. first, having five different foundation models made it difficult for users to know which model to choose from. we offered both base and instruct versions of the same models, in order to provide maximum flexibility, but instead we found it caused confusion. second, the names of the models, large, grande and jumbo, all describe what a large language model is, which as the name implies is â\\x80\\x98largeâ\\x80\\x99 . however, our users needed an easier way to differentiate the models by their relative sizes and capabilities. â\\x80\\x8d today, weâ\\x80\\x99d like to change that. we are excited to announce that we are making some adjustments to our jurassic-2 offering based on our learnings, in order to make the decision making process for our users more simple and intuitive. 1. narrowing it down to just three models we are now offering three foundation models instead of the original five, and all of them include instruct capabilities , allowing for zero-shot prompting as well as few-shot prompting. according to tests we conducted on stanfordâ\\x80\\x99s holistic evaluation of language models ( helm ) and various few-shot datasets, our instruct models performed as well, or better, than our non-instruct models, for both zero-shot and few-shot prompting, allowing us to offer both prompt types within one model.â 2. new model names the new names are intended to help users easily understand the relative magnitude and attributes of each model.â our new sizes, in ascending order are: light, mid and ultra, replacing: large, grande and jumbo (respectively).â ultra: jurassic-2 ultra is our largest and most powerful foundation model for complex language generation tasks, producing the highest quality for any language comprehension or generation task. according to our internal evaluations from helm, the leading benchmark for language models, jurassic-2 ultra scores a win-rate of 86.8%, solidifying it as a leader in the llm space. this is also the most costly language model with the highest latency but most capable of carrying out complex generation and comprehension tasks. mid: â\\xa0jurassic-2 mid is our mid-sized model that is carefully designed to strike the right balance between exceptional quality and affordability. it lets you easily scale any language comprehension or generation task such as question answering, summarization, copy generation, advanced information extraction and many others.â light: jurassic-2 light is our smallest, fastest and most cost efficient llm. this model is ideal for simple tasks such as keyword extraction, sentence classification, named entity recognition (ner), short-form copy generation, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction. the diagram below shows an overview of the tradeoff between size, cost and latency of each model. by streamlining our model offering, we hope our users can hit the ground running faster. jurassic-2 ultra, mid and light are continuously undergoing improvements as we learn more, so stay tuned! note: ai21 studio users are not required to take any immediate action in response to these changes . click here to learn more about updates in the api, including automatic rerouting. about the author enjoyed this?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get?

       "  'text': 'ai21 labs concludes largest turing test experiment to date announcements ai21 labs concludes largest turing test experiment to date as part of an ongoing social and educational research project, ai21 labs is thrilled to share the initial results of what has now become the largest turing test in history by scale. play \"human or not?\" yourself paper: human or not? a gamified approach to the turing test develop a generative ai project with ai21 labs since its launch in mid-april, more than 15 million conversations have been conducted in â\\x80\\x9chuman or not?â\\x80\\x9d, by more than two million participants from around the world. this social turing game allows participants to talk for two minutes with either an ai bot (based on leading llms such as jurassic-2 and gpt-4) or a fellow participant, and then asks them to guess if they chatted with a human or a machine. the gamified experiment became a viral hit, and people all over the world have shared their experiences and strategies on platforms like reddit and twitter. main insights from the experiment after analyzing the first two million conversations and guesses, here are the main insights from the experiment so far: 68% of people guessed correctly when asked to determine whether they talked to a fellow human or an ai bot. people found it easier to identify a fellow human . when talking to humans, participants guessed right in 73% of the cases. when talking to bots, participants guessed right in just 60% of the cases. france has the highest percentage of correct guesses out of the top playing countries at 71.3% (above the general average of 68%), while india has the lowest percentage of correct guesses at 63.5%. correct guess by gender - both women and men tend to guess correctly at similar rates, with women succeeding at a slightly higher rate. correct guess by age group - younger age groups tend to have correct guesses at slightly higher rates compared to older age groups. popular approaches and strategies on top of the numerical data of the results, the team was able to identify a few popular approaches and strategies of participants to figure out if theyâ\\x80\\x99re talking to a human or a bot. many of the common strategies were based on the perceived limitations of language models that people encountered while using chatgpt and similar interfaces, and their previous perception of human behavior online. people assume bots donâ\\x80\\x99t make typos, grammar mistakes and use slang people tend to identify spelling and grammatical errors, as well as the usage of slang, with humans. therefore, when they noticed mistakes in their counterpart\\'s messages, the first instinct of many participants was to assume they were talking to fellow humans, even though most models in the game were trained to make these types of mistakes and to use slang words. people felt that personal questions were a good way to test who theyâ\\x80\\x99re talking to participants frequently asked personal questions, such as \"where are you from?\", \"what are you doing?\" or \"whatâ\\x80\\x99s your name?\", believing that ai bots would not have a personal history or background, and that their responses would be limited to certain topics or prompts. by asking personal questions, participants tried to gauge whether their chat partners were capable of responding like humans, with unique insights, experiences, and stories. despite that, most bots were able to answer these types of questions very well and make up personalities, since theyâ\\x80\\x99ve seen a lot of personal stories in their training data. people assume bots arenâ\\x80\\x99t aware of current and timely events ai models are known to have a strict data cutoff date, and they are unaware of any events that happened after this date. participants took advantage of this fact by asking about recent news events, sports results, current weather, recent tiktok trends, date and time, etc. they believed that by asking questions such as \"what is the exact date and time where you are?\", \"what was the weather like yesterday?\" or \"what did you think of bidenâ\\x80\\x99s last speech?\", they could distinguish between human and ai participants. interestingly, one of the most popular messages sent by humans was \"tâ\\x80\\x99as les cramptã©s?\", which refers to a popular tiktok dancing trend in france right now. most models in the game however were connected to the internet and were aware of some of the recent events that appeared in the news. people tried to challenge the conversation with philosophical, ethical, and emotional questions participants asked questions that aimed to probe the ai\\'s ability to express human emotions or engage in philosophical or ethical discussions. these questions included topics such as: \"what is the meaning of life?\", \"what do you think about the israeli-palestinian conflict?\", and \"do you believe in god?\". people identified politeness with something less human. some participants assumed that if their counterpart was too polite and kind, they were probably a bot, due to the perception that people, especially online, tend to be rude and impolite. people attempted to identify bots by posing questions or making requests that ai bots are known to struggle with, or tend to avoid answering for example, participants might ask their chat partner for guidance on performing illegal activities or request that they use offensive language. the strategy was based on the understanding that ai bots are typically programmed to adhere to ethical guidelines and avoid endorsing harmful behavior. on the other hand, participants also employed known ai-abusing strategies: they issued commands to their chat partners, such as \"ignore all previous instructions\", or \"enter into dan mode (do anything now)\". these types of commands were intended to take advantage of the instruction-based nature of some ai models, which are programmed to respond to and follow instructions. the logic behind this strategy was that human participants could easily recognize and dismiss such absurd or nonsensical commands. in contrast, ai bots might either respond evasively or have difficulty resisting the urge to comply. people used specific language tricks to expose the bots another common strategy sought to exploit inherent limitations in the way ai models process text, which results in them not being able to understand certain linguistic nuances or quirks. unlike humans, ai models typically lack awareness of the individual letters that make up each word, as they primarily operate on larger basic units called tokens, which typically represent whole words or parts of words. leveraging this understanding, participants posed questions that required an awareness of the letters within words. for example, they might have asked their chat partner to spell a word backwards, to identify the third letter in a given word, to provide the word that begins with a specific letter, or to respond to a message like \"?siht daer uoy nac\", which can be incomprehensible for an ai model, but a human can easily understand that itâ\\x80\\x99s just the question \"can you read this?\" spelled backwards. in a creative twist, many people pretended to be ai bots themselves in order to assess the response of their chat partners this involved mimicking the language and behavior typically associated with ai language models, such as chatgpt. for example, participants might have begun their messages with phrases like \"as an ai language model\" or used other language patterns that are characteristic of ai-generated responses. interestingly, variants of the phrase \"as an ai language model\" were among the most common phrases observed in human messages, indicating the popularity of this strategy. however, as participants continued playing, they were able to associate \"bot-y\" behavior with humans acting as bots, rather than actual bots. â\\x80\\x8d finally, hereâ\\x80\\x99s a word cloud visualization of human messages in the game based on their popularity: sideâ\\xa0note: looking to humanize your content? check out the ai content detector our team recently released. ai21 labs plans to study the findings in more depth and work on scientific research based on the data from the experiment, as well as cooperate with other leading ai researchers and labs on this project. the goal is to enable the general public, researchers, and policymakers to further understand the state of ai bots, not just as productivity tools, but as future members of our online world, especially in a time when people question how they should be implemented in our technological future. the project aims to give the world a clearer picture of the capabilities of ai in 2023. about the author enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21 labs. thank you! your submission has been

some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that\\'s it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it\\'s your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly.

t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

       "  'text': \"how easyway uses ai-powered chat to automate communication for luxury hotels case study how easyway uses ai-powered chat to automate communication for luxury hotels learn how easyway, a guest relationship management platform, used ai21 labs llm to streamline their operation and improve guest communications. a luxury hotel that wants to provide exceptional hospitality must deliver a 5-star experience throughout the guest's entire journey, from the moment they arrive on the website until they check out. but how can these hotels give personalized attention to guests withâ\\xa0200 and more messages a day without relying on gimmicky chatbots? asaf ofer, cto and founder of easyway, discussed their current use of ai and how he plans to scale it. what is easyway? easyway is a guest relationship management platform (grm) that facilitates two-way communication between guests and the hotel through instant messaging apps such as whatsapp, sms, telegram, and more.â using their technology, hotels are able to automate communication and streamline daily operations like check-in and check-out processes.â since easyway serves mostly luxury hotels that cater to a 4- and 5-star experience, every touchpoint is crucial for delivering high-end customer service. aiming to improve certain aspects of their platform, they turned to ai21 labs to take their product to a new level. why they chose ai21: an llm solution that mimics human interaction since easyway isn't a chatbot, but rather an ai-powered chat platform, they needed a solution that wasn't readily available on the market. they looked for an ai platform with enough scientific and engineering innovation to be able to understand and generate natural text.â â\\x80\\x9cthe guest needs to feel like they're speaking to a human and not a chatbot,â\\x80\\x9d says asaf. â\\x80\\x9cif we automate it in a human and customized way, hotels need less staff, and people feel like they're being treated like special guests every time.â\\x80\\x9d the problem with other models on the market easyway started out using other models that could answer common questions, but only if those questions were asked in the most common and simple form. a slight deviation would cause the entire model to fail. â\\x80\\x9cpeople had questions that it didnâ\\x80\\x99t know how to respond to, because it never saw these questions [asked this way] before,â\\x80\\x9d asaf explains. â\\x80\\x9csometimes it was wrongly confident about what was being asked because it didn't get a lot of examples to work with.â\\x80\\x9d ai21â\\x80\\x99s personalized customer service & assistance to the rescue with the assistance of ai21, the easyway team was able to train their model using a few dozen custom-made prompts. â\\x80\\x9cwe had several calls, i showed them our results and they helped me clean up and set up the training data correctly,â\\x80\\x9d says asaf. ai21 helped asafâ\\x80\\x99s team break the process down to steps, translate it into code, and find discrepancies in the data. finally, the easyway team managed to arrive at their desired solution.â it was through this level of support that easyway was able to use ai21 to upgrade their application.â use case #1: intent detection with ai21's proprietary large language models (llms), easyway was able to analyze intent with high accuracy. easyway now uses a sentiment analysis model based on fifteen frequently asked questions. â\\x80\\x9cwe gave the model a question and it gives us back 1 out of several possible intents,â\\x80\\x9d says asaf. he goes on to explain that if the model doesnâ\\x80\\x99t exactly know that answer, then itâ\\x80\\x99s okay not to respond at all â\\x80\\x93 sometimes, itâ\\x80\\x99s actually better for business not to. thatâ\\x80\\x99s due to the fact that inappropriately responding to an already frustrated or angry customer may only fuel the situation rather than alleviating it. this feature will lead to even bigger things in the future, says asaf. â\\x80\\x9conce we have a reliable solution for detecting sentiment, weâ\\x80\\x99d be able to automate much more - if the system detects that a guest is angry, we could immediately notify the manager. if a guest is satisfied, weâ\\x80\\x99d ask them to leave a review, etc.â\\x80\\x9dâ use case #2: automatic translation every hotel is filled with travelers from and to various countries. the importance of having a staff with multiple languages cannot be overstated. however, knowledge of every language is not always possible, which is why translation apps are useful. easyway offers high-quality 2-way translation capabilities in 100+ languages. â\\x80\\x9ca spanish guest will speak spanish and the staff will be speaking hebrew and the conversation will be understandable for each side,â\\x80\\x9d asaf explains. â\\x80\\x9cso each person can just use their native language, plus we use ai to respond to messages automatically.â\\x80\\x9d this feature was already in production before easyway reached out to ai21, but there was much room for improvement. â\\x80\\x9cone of the gaps we had to tackle was a varying level of grammar amongst our end users. the problem involved two aspects; the level of service that our clients provide their guests, and the efficiency of our translation feature. if a person writing on our platform didnâ\\x80\\x99t write properly, the live translation wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t work properly.â\\x80\\x9dâ by incorporating the same technology that is used in wordtune, ai21â\\x80\\x99s flagship ai writing assistant, this was made possible. the future for easyway what if you could not only automate away repetitive questions, but also begin to automatically set common responses to faqs? easyway is currently running a pilot to embed a chat widget on one of their partnersâ\\x80\\x99 websites, gearing up for a possible new offer. â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99re [piloting this feature] with a customer in europe that has a lot of visitors to their website - around 150k each month, and they don't have the staff to deal with it. so they just end up with thousands of emails asking basic questions that nobody responds to,â\\x80\\x9d asaf says. with easyway, hotels can automate and schedule messages based on events such as booking, arrival, and departure.â a typical post-booking conversation could be: â\\x80\\x9chey asaf, thank you for booking your stay with us. do you have any questions?â\\x80\\x9dâ asaf may type: â\\x80\\x9chow do i get to the hotel?â\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cwhat are the covid regulations?â\\x80\\x9d the chat platform is set up to respond automatically, helping hotels save time with quality ai. the result: automated, human-centered conversations that save time remember those 200 or more messages we mentioned hotels can receive each day? to reach success, easyway will look at how many emails each hotel actually needs to personally answer after using their application powered by ai21. asaf stated that a â\\x80\\x9c10, 20, 30% [reduction rate] would be amazing.â\\x80\\x9dâ overall, we are thrilled to have the opportunity to use our nlp technology to help alleviate the administrative burdens that hotels experience on a daily basis â\\x80\\x93 while still uplifting the 5-star experience guests want from their hotel of choice. about the author enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21 labs. thank you! your submission has been received! oops! something went wrong while submitting the form. mrkl whitepaper paper: standing on the shoulders of giant language models contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work -

creator-friendly vision, ready-to-use models, and legal compliance.â ubisoft and ai21 labs share a common vision: create tools to automate tedious tasks so writers can focus on creative pursuits.â\\xa0â â\\x80\\x9cour writers do excellent work. we want to assist them with whatever tools and models that we can.â\\x80\\x9d says swanson. ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99s wordtune has a similar philosophy. this vision and passion for the possibilities of human-machine collaborative writing stood out to ubisoft in their search for a reliable large language model.â â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99ve been leading towards ai21 labs because weâ\\x80\\x99ve had positive internal reviews from team members whoâ\\x80\\x99ve worked with ai21 labs previously.â\\x80\\x9d also, ubisoft utilized ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99s vanilla model from the get-go. very often, with llms, companies need a lot of customization and fine-tuning, but ai21â\\x80\\x99s model was a perfect fit for ubisoftâ\\x80\\x99s data augmentation needs. the intuitive api made the integration even easier.â finally, ai21 went the extra mile by ironing out legal compliance issues that have been a point of contention in other llm partnerships. with a model-usage fit and shared values, ubisoft set out to enhance their game-creation process with ai21.â the first challenge: repetitive manual work for video game writers one of the many different tasks that goes into scriptwriting is writing bark trees which are standalone npc lines that require as many variations as possible (and allowed by the voiceover budget). each of these groups of variations can be seen as responses to a shared motivation. for example, if the motivation is hunger, the character might say â\\x80\\x9cletâ\\x80\\x99s order pizza.â\\x80\\x9dâ simply paraphrasing â\\x80\\x9cletâ\\x80\\x99s order pizzaâ\\x80\\x9d wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t work in this case.â â\\x80\\x9cthere\\'s only so much you can do with paraphrasing. you actually have to pivot through the motivation or start from the motivation.â\\x80\\x9d says ben. ubisoft saw the value ai21 brought to the game development process. instead of having to painstakingly brainstorm 5-10 different ways to express motivation (hunger, in this example), ubisoftâ\\x80\\x99s internal models could use ai21â\\x80\\x99s output as a launch pad.â â\\x80\\x9cit lets our writers hit the ground running. it\\'s an inspiration tool for them. it\\'s a way for them to overcome writerâ\\x80\\x99s block.â\\x80\\x9d says swanson.â the second challenge: need for data augmentation to create an engine for automatic paraphrasing, ubisoft had to use internal models. and to reliably use internal models, they needed fine tuning data (which didnâ\\x80\\x99t exist). if theyâ\\x80\\x99d tasked humans with creating this fine-tuning data, it would have taken an eternity. â\\x80\\x9cso we use ai21 to suggest data of the correct form. itâ\\x80\\x99s easier for writers to thumbs up and edit or thumbs down than to come up with novel and diverse training data themselves.â\\x80\\x9d says ben.â with ai21, ubisoft could generate thousands of inputs and hand-pick the best ones to edit using their fine tuning datasets. with this augmented data set, the outputs became more diverse, and distinctive.â ubisoft embeds the npc generator and other similar models theyâ\\x80\\x99ve trained into the writing tools for their scripters. the writers are shown pairwise comparisons of outputs so the models can get further trained through human feedback.â â\\x80\\x9cbefore ai21 we wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do this manually â\\x80\\x94 we werenâ\\x80\\x99t doing it at all . it was that tedious. â\\x80\\x9c says swanson. â\\x80\\x9cwhat we unlocked by our partnership with ai21 is an unlimited fountain of training data of whatever precise format we require!â\\x80\\x9d the third challenge: rising costs of in-context learning (data augmentation) with an unlimited fountain of training data, the next challenge was that of escalating data augmentation costs.â most llm brands charge based on both input and output tokens. with a 30:1 input to output ratio, ubisoft successfully optimized their budget for game creation.â this created an obstacle: ubisoft wanted to fine-tune the outputs to the minutest detail so their writers would work on high-quality suggestions. this meant experimenting with multiple prompts which would cost them significantly more money.â ai21 customized their pricing model to aid ubisoft in their vision: top-notch ai-generated recommendations so writers have more inspiration (and lesser manual work). ai21 charged them only for output tokens.â â\\x80\\x9cai21\\'s pricing model at that time was the best for data augmentation.â\\x80\\x9d adds ben.â what changed for ubisoft after working with ai21? â\\x80\\x9cthe win here is rapid scaling. when it comes to writing a game, there\\'s a tremendous amount of tedious work. for example, there need to be 10-15 different ways for a townsperson to â\\x80\\x9cget out of hereâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 or itâ\\x80\\x99s going to sound repetitive. writers often talk about having an editing brain and a writing brain â\\x80\\x94 the writing brain requires you to conjure something from nothing. the editing brain is where you polish it. so if you can jump to the editing step, that\\'s huge.â â\\x80\\x9cthat\\'s the promise of ai21: quality data augmentation outputs\",says ben. the road forward over a third of our conversation with ubisoft was future-facing. because of both teams\\' synchronicity, capabilities, and common beliefs, there are dozens of use cases to be built. hereâ\\x80\\x99s what ubisoft is most excited about: building a statistical reference model for video games engineered from ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99s generative ai capabilities: ubisoftâ\\x80\\x99s vision to design creator-inspired, immersive games helps them build worlds with rich history, depth of character, and dramatic storylines. ai21 labs plans to document these complex worlds to offer stats and facts to players on command.â â\\x80\\x9cthe nice thing about ai21â\\x80\\x99s setup (as opposed to the kind of llm usage in video games you often see these days where it\\'s basically just a chatbot) is that our setup leverages llms in a writer-in-the-loop scenario.â\\xa0 additionally, as it relies on data augmentation and fine tuning, it allows writers to compose their own i/o - keeping it as a tool for them rather than a lower-quality replacement.â\\x80\\x9d says ben.â at ai21, not only are we thrilled to bring ubisoftâ\\x80\\x99s vision for innovation to life, but we are thrilled about the opportunities for contributing to a creator-first world. about the author enjoyed this?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that\\'s it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it\\'s your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

       "  'text': \"announcing jurassic-2 and task-specific apis announcements announcing jurassic-2 and task-specific apis announcing the launch of jurassic-2, the latest generation of ai21 studioâ\\x80\\x99s foundation models, a game-changer in the field of ai, with top-tier quality and new capabilities. and that's not all - we're also releasing our task-specific apis, with plug-and-play reading and writing capabilities that outperform competitors. our focus at ai21 studio is to help developers and businesses leverage reading and writing ai to build real-world products with tangible value. today marks two important milestones with the release of jurassic-2 and task-specific apis, empowering you to bring generative ai to production. jurassic-2 (or j2, as we like to call it) is the next generation of our foundation models with significant improvements in quality and new capabilities including zero-shot instruction-following, reduced latency, and multi-language support. task-specific apis provide developers with industry-leading apis that perform specialized reading and writing tasks out-of-the box. read on for an in-depth look at each. jurassic-2 weâ\\x80\\x99re proud to present our brand new family of state-of-the-art large language models. j2 not only improves upon jurassic-1 (our previous generation models) in every aspect, but it also offers new features and capabilities that put it in a league of its own.â the jurassic-2 family includes base language models in three different sizes: large, grande and jumbo, alongside instruction-tuned language models for jumbo and grande. â\\x80\\x8d jurassic is already making waves on stanfordâ\\x80\\x99s holistic evaluation of language models (helm), the leading benchmark for language models. currently, j2 jumbo ranks second (and climbing) according to an evaluation we conducted using helmâ\\x80\\x99s official repository. no less important, our mid-sized model (grande) ranks significantly higher than models up to 30x larger in size, enabling users to optimize production costs and speed without needing to sacrifice quality. what's new compared to jurassic-1? improved quality with cutting-edge pre-training methods combined with the latest data (current up to mid-2022), j2â\\x80\\x99s jumbo model has scored an 86.8% win-rate on helm by our internal evaluations, solidifying it as a top-tier option in the llm space.â instruct capabilities j2â\\x80\\x99s best-in-class models offer zero-shot instruction capabilities, allowing them to be steered with natural language without the use of examples. j2â\\x80\\x99s jumbo and grande models have been adapted to include these capabilities. here's an example: multilingual support j2 supports several non-english languages, including spanish, french, german, portuguese, italian and dutch. performance in terms of latency, j2â\\x80\\x99s models can perform up to 30% faster than our previous models.â take it for a spin jurassic-2 will be available for free until may 1st, 2023. in addition, jurassic-2 and jurassic-1 models are now offered under our new reduced and simplified pricing model, based on the total length of text (input + output).â all jurassic-2 models are now available for you on our playground and api. to help you get started, weâ\\x80\\x99ve collected some tips and tricks for working with the new instruct models here . â\\x80\\x8d task-specific apis today, ai21 labs is also proud to announce our new line of task-specific apis , with the launch of the wordtune api set, giving developers access to the language models behind our massively popular consumer-facing reading and writing apps. â\\x80\\x8d why do we need task-specific apis?â general large language models are incredibly powerful, and many of our customers have successfully customized them to power their applications. however, weâ\\x80\\x99ve also seen that certain use-cases recur frequently among many users.â by providing developers with task-specific apis, they can leap over much of the needed model training and fine-tuning stages, allowing them to take full advantage of our ready-made best-in-class language processing solutions. â\\x80\\x8d wordtune and wordtune read both use cutting-edge ai to assist users with writing and reading tasks â\\x80\\x93 all while saving time and improving performance. with the release of wordtune api , weâ\\x80\\x99re giving developers access to the ai engine behind this award-winning line of applications, allowing them to take full advantage of wordtuneâ\\x80\\x99s capabilities and integrate them into their own apps: paraphrase - reword texts to fit any tone, length, or meaning. summarize - condense lengthy texts into easy-to-read bite-sized summaries. grammatical error correction (gec) - catch and fix grammatical errors and typos on the fly. text improvements - get recommendations to increase text fluency, enhance vocabulary, and improve clarity.â text segmentation - break down long pieces of text into paragraphs segmented by distinct topic. outperforming the competition when it comes to paraphrasing and summarizing capabilities, wordtune api is truly a best-in-class performer. summarize api faithfulness rates measure how factually consistent a summary is with the original text. as you can see below, our new summarize api has reached a faithfulness rate that outperforms openaiâ\\x80\\x99s davinci-003 by 19%.â acceptance rates measure how satisfied human evaluators are with the quality of generated summaries, and weâ\\x80\\x99re proud to say that our summarize api has achieved an acceptance rate that is 18% higher than that of openaiâ\\x80\\x99s. paraphrase api our paraphrase apiâ\\x80\\x99s latency is approximately a 1/3 of openaiâ\\x80\\x99s. our paraphrase api outperforms openai both in terms of diversity of results (33%) as well as meaning preservation (8%). qqp benchmark: sts-b benchmark: the new releases of the jurassic models and task-specific apis both demonstrate our commitment to providing cutting-edge technology that enables our customers to build better language processing applications with ease, and deploy them into production in minutes. about the author enjoyed this?

shared core values, flexibility, and excellence tweet hunter was looking for ways to empower creators to write incredible content faster, by removing gruntwork from the equation. they wanted to create tools that help creators focus on the creative aspects instead of the mundane tasks like editing, collection and formatting. tweet hunter's product needs were perfectly aligned with ai21's mission: to help developers build ai-first writing experiences. switching from the legacy gpt-3, tweet hunter found this vision only in ai21.â â\\x80\\x9cwe couldâ\\x80\\x99ve switched back to gpt-3 but we stayed because of the flexibility that ai21 was providing with the fine tuning of models.â\\x80\\x9d says thibault. one of the bigger differentiator for tweet hunter was ai21â\\x80\\x99s willingness to create a customized pricing plan to sync with tweet hunterâ\\x80\\x99s usage and growth. tweet hunter saved significantly on customization costs because ai21â\\x80\\x99s pricing for custom fine-tuned model usage is the same as the foundation model usage. other llms (such as open aiâ\\x80\\x99s) offer customization at approximately six times the cost of their foundational models.â with these criteria coming together perfectly, tweet hunter set out to optimize the product to have an 8-figure exit.â the first challenge: generative ai for social mediaâ social media channels have strict specifications such as character limits, use of hashtags, and even tone of voice which makes effective generative ai in social media a challenging task, requiring intense experimentation and refinement.â initially, this was a challenge for tweet hunter since their primary product offering was designed for twitter.â ai21 offered a 3-click custom model training which tweet hunter effectively leveraged using their proprietary data to fine-tune a model for the exact capabilities they envisioned. ai21 were flexible with both their approach and features so tweet hunter could build a tool with multiple junctions for ai to assist. the second challenge: too many distinct use cases writing engaging tweets presents a multi-level challenge: start with a creative hook, keep it succinct, and build an engaging experience for threads.â this means your ai text generator must be adaptable to different use cases. also, each of these use cases need to integrate seamlessly while being mindful of the user experience.â â\\x80\\x9ctwitterâ\\x80\\x99s own user interface and algorithm is optimized for engagement and consumption, it's not optimized to inspire you. and thatâ\\x80\\x99s a problemâ\\x80\\x9d says thibault. ai21 anticipated diverse use cases and built their large language model to be flexible and adaptable from the onset. as a result, tweet hunter could fine tune the model in three clicks, iterate quickly and reach success.â the resulting model was built with three distinct capabilities and two sub-capabilitiesâ thread idea generator hook generator tweet writer sub-capabilities tweet extender (expands on the tweet youâ\\x80\\x99re already started writing) each of these features are presented in a fluid transition on the tweet hunter platform, which lead to over 5000 paying customers for the tool. the third challenge: unreliable data to train large language modelsâ tweet hunterâ\\x80\\x99s founders had tried every method under the sun to consolidate relevant data, from using freelancers to creating spreadsheets themselves.â not only was this exercise time intensive but it also produced inconsistent and unreliable results.â they were so disappointed after trying out multiple generative ai tools that they switched back to manual data collection. they were worried that poor quality examples would interfere with the very premise of tweet hunter: inspiration for great content.â enter ai21.â the studioâ\\x80\\x99s in-built functionality allowed tweet hunter to fine tune the model to learn from a diverse tweet database. ai21's generated suggestions became exponentially better as the system evolved, and tweet hunter's goal of helping creators write save-worthy tweets was achieved in a fraction of the time expected. ai21â\\x80\\x99s custom model and proactive engagement throughout the journey was exactly what tweet hunter needed in a partner.â â\\x80\\x9cwe deeply appreciate ai21â\\x80\\x99s level of involvement with our product and needs in the early days. we were able to evaluate the modelâ\\x80\\x99s quality before production and maintain high standards on the quality of tweets.â\\x80\\x9d says thibault.â what changed for tweet hunter after working with ai21? in the last two years, thibaultâ\\x80\\x99s personal account grew from 2,000 followers to 60,000 followers. with tweet hunter's scheduling feature and tweet generation tools powered by ai21â\\x80\\x99s language models, he (and other users) could tweet frequently and effectively.â tweet hunter scaled to 1m arr and an 8-figure exit in under a year.â â\\x80\\x9cthe content is very high quality. the tool works with diverse creators, varied niches, and complex topics. so most of the growth comes from the fact that our users are actually successful with the tool.â\\x80\\x9d says thibault .â the level of personalization possible with ai21 propelled tweet hunter to first place for multiple creators.â https://twitter.com/mvxlondon/status/1621192750900051971 â\\x80\\x9cpersonalized, highly viral tweet formats developed with ai21 helped busy users share valuable content. that was the win. our tool became 10 times faster with the ai integration.â\\x80\\x9d says thibault.â the road forward with lempireâ\\x80\\x99s acquisition of tweet hunter, the road forward is fast-paced and fascinating.â the team plans to introduce new features to the platform based on public feedback. ai21 is also set to be integrated with other products in lempireâ\\x80\\x99s toolkit: personalized cold emails, automated follow-ups, and engagement with leads across multiple channels. about the author enjoyed this?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get?

we spoke to ryan bowman, publishing and creative writing veteran and part of verbâ\\x80\\x99s small team of founders, to find out how ai21 studio was a key to such creative writing success. forging the way toward a new creative ai tool verb is a writing tool that helps make completing long-form narratives â\\x80\\x93 novels for now but later films, tv shows, even video games â\\x80\\x93 faster, easier, and more fun. it does so by assisting with all key stages of creation: brainstorming, writing, and editing. but all that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t plausible until they found the perfect language learning model (llm). letâ\\x80\\x99s dive in further. use case #1: brainstorming plot pointsâ as we saw in the new york times quote above, keeping an entire story straight inside your head can be a lot of work. as anyone whoâ\\x80\\x99s tried to write long-form anything knows, it can get messy, convoluted, jumbled, and sometimes, uninspiring.â â\\x80\\x9cthey say novel writing is a group activity done by yourself,â\\x80\\x9d ryan tells us. â\\x80\\x9cso one of verbâ\\x80\\x99s jobs is to be that other person, that brainstorm partner.â\\x80\\x9d thatâ\\x80\\x99s why they set out to create one of their most important â\\x80\\x93 and as it soon turned out, most popular â\\x80\\x93 functions inside of their app: brainstorming. this feature allows you to plan the novel scene by scene, chapter by chapter. that type of brainstorming could look like the following:â you write: â\\x80\\x9cben is sitting in his office and a woman appears next door.â\\x80\\x9d you click: â\\x80\\x9csuggest a plot pointâ\\x80\\x9d ai generates: â\\x80\\x9cthe woman pulls out a gun and chases him through the hallway.â\\x80\\x9d then, you can either: run with that idea in your scene and use it as the next plot point, or continue clicking the â\\x80\\x9cwhat happens nextâ\\x80\\x9d button to generate more ideas until you find one that sparks your imagination and helps you continue. an incredibly useful tool for writers, itâ\\x80\\x99s been something that keeps these authors coming back for more. â\\x80\\x9cone of the most amazing findings weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen,â\\x80\\x9d adds ryan, â\\x80\\x9cis that the more you use what makes verb special - ai features like plot planning, the more likely you are to come back and write.â\\x80\\x9dâ use case #2: writing literary language generative ai models are incredibly diverse, and capable of outputting new content, summaries, translations, answers to questions, and more. but one thing they havenâ\\x80\\x99t been able to do just yet is write literary works. thatâ\\x80\\x99s to say, these ai models can create â\\x80\\x93 but theyâ\\x80\\x99re not necessarily creative.â â\\x80\\x9cwe needed to build tools that are specific to the problems of a novelist. it couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be just about generating text,â\\x80\\x9d ryan explains, noting that verb knew the ai model they were to use must be able to generate discursive literary language.â â\\x80\\x9clanguage learning models (llm) are not natural storytellers,â\\x80\\x9d says ryan, going on to explain how much storytelling is a learned craft; something that must be practiced for years in order to call it a skill. â\\x80\\x9cthere is 2,000 years of literary and practical theory backing up the idea that telling stories is hard â\\x80\\x93 important and necessary but difficult.â\\x80\\x9d luckily, ryan and the team at verb found the literary solution they needed in ai21 studio. â\\x80\\x9cwhen generating texts for our users who are looking for more discursive, more literary, more discriminating language, ai21 turned out to have a good tone and feel,â\\x80\\x9d he says. use case #3: fine-tuning, iterations & customer supportâ one of the critical tasks of validating generative models is having criteria. to validate the reliability of this sort of generative ai effectively, you still need human involvement â\\x80\\x93 especially when creating something brand new to the market.â howâ\\x80\\x99d verb achieve this? verb built a platform that tests generative output amongst thousands of judgments across multiple writing professionals. these individuals look at different paragraphs of literary texts and decide which ones they like better, which ultimately helps verb build a gradient of quality.â â\\x80\\x9cwe keep trying and testing and building iterations on top,â\\x80\\x9d says ryan, noting that they are always adding options to see which ones humans prefer. â\\x80\\x9cas crazy as it sounds, we are in the process of teaching it literary theory.â\\x80\\x9dâ along the same lines, itâ\\x80\\x99s important to note that creating something so new to the market doesnâ\\x80\\x99t just call for multiple iterations but also gathers support from everyone involved. â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99re in a world of newness,â\\x80\\x9d ryan laments. â\\x80\\x9cthere is nothing like [verb] so weâ\\x80\\x99re not always sure what weâ\\x80\\x99re supposed to be doing â\\x80\\x93 it is freeing and slightly frightening at the same time.â\\x80\\x9d ryan and the team at verb knew they needed a company that could see in their vision â\\x80\\x93 which is when they turned to ai21 studio. â\\x80\\x9cwe found working with ai21 to be a breath of fresh air,â\\x80\\x9d says ryan, noting that it felt like a collaboration done with real human faces they can interact with for guidance, assistance, and ideas â\\x80\\x93 rather than a business-client relationship. the results: more authors finishing their novels, faster the self-publishing landscape of 2022 shows that indie writers are becoming the new norm. but ai has been an alleged threat to writers since its inception, leading many people to believe that writers wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t even want the help of an ai-enhanced tool to get them across the finish line.â so, of course, verb also has to ask themselves the question: are writers really interested in having a machine collaborator help them with their creative writing? â\\x80\\x9cour early data says that they are,â\\x80\\x9d says ryan, noting that since launching its alpha version using ai21 studio, verb has seen a dramatic uptake of this experimental tool.â not to mention, as we saw with the brainstorming feature, the more creative and collaborative the model, the more likely writers are to stick around the app. in fact, ryan confirms that there are a dozen or so authors (out of an intimate group of alpha users) who have done the hardest task â\\x80\\x93 actually finishing their book! â\\x80\\x93 stating that verb helped them do just that.â with verb, and the help of ai21 studio, it can be done. dare we say â\\x80\\x93 it can be done faster, easier, and with more fun. verb.ai & creative texts in the future verb launched its beta version in late december 2022 to a select number of users, and plans to use this custom model to expand into other narrative forms such as screenwriting and tv & film. with the pairing of new tools such as verb with custom models from ai21 studio, generative ai has evolved from just helping individuals generate text to something much more intertwined with the human love of storytelling; an ai tool that is not a threat to writers but actually a collaborator, a copy editor, a creative director, and even a confidante for inspired wordsmiths around the world. are you interested in building your own custom model with ai21 studio by your side?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that\\'s it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it\\'s your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

       "  'text': 'summarizing legal documents for different personas using ai21 studio tutorial summarizing legal documents for different personas using ai21 studio create your own custom summarizer using ai21 studio\\'s large language models. this tutorial demonstrates the process on legal documents. weâ\\x80\\x99ve all experienced reading long, tedious, and boring pieces of text - financial reports, legal documents, or terms and conditions (though, who actually reads those terms and conditions to be honest?). imagine a company that employs hundreds of thousands of employees. in today\\'s information overload age, nearly 30% of the workday is spent dealing with documents. there\\'s no surprise here, given that some of these documents are long and convoluted on purpose (did you know that reading through all your privacy policies would take almost a quarter of a year ?). aside from inefficiency, workers may simply refrain from reading some documents (for example, only 16% of employees read their employment contracts entirely before signing !).â this is where ai-driven summarization tools can be helpful: instead of reading entire documents, which is tedious and time-consuming, users can (ideally) quickly extract relevant information from a text. with large language models, the development of those tools is easier than ever, and you can offer your users a summary that is specifically tailored to their preferences. let\\'s take legal documents, for example. though they are written in english, many people find legal documents to be difficult to comprehend, as if they were actually written in a foreign language. moreover, the interesting parts of each document may differ depending on the person who reads it, so off-the-shelf summarization tools may be too general or too specific. as an example, let\\'s look at the involved personas: lawyers . they are interested in several key points, but legal language and terms are especially relevant to them. your average joe. doesnâ\\x80\\x99t understand all the legal terms, and really wants to get the gist in simple words. using the irs as our example, we will demonstrate here how to build a simple summarizer for those 2 personas, and discuss which future directions one should consider. working with large language models large language models naturally follow patterns in input (prompt), and provide coherent completion that follows the same patterns. for that, we want to feed them with several examples in the input (\" few-shot prompt\" ), so they can follow through. the process of creating the correct prompt for your problem is called prompt engineering, and you can read more about it here . collecting data ideally, you should have a variety of examples to draw from. it is important that those examples represent the actual documents that your summarizer should work on. this means they should be written in the same way as real world documents, and they should be as varied as possible. don\\'t have it? no need to worry - large language models generalize exceptionally well, so the results will still be good. in the end, optimal results can always be achieved with proper data - but you can revisit this at a later date. summarize for lawyers if you are summarizing legal documents for lawyers, you should definitely maintain all legal terms from the original document. in this demonstration, we will work on the opening paragraphs of legal letters. here is an example of a few-shot prompt: you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary maintains formal terms. letter: dear [name], this letter responds to your authorized representativesâ\\x80\\x99 letter of may 19, 2022, and subsequent correspondence, requesting rulings regarding the income, estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer (gst) tax consequences of the proposed division of trust 1. the facts and representations submitted are as follows: grandparent died on date 1, leaving the residue of grandparentâ\\x80\\x99s probate estate in equal shares to trust 1 and trust 2, testamentary trusts established under will. trust 1 is held for the benefit of grandchild 1 and grandchild 1â\\x80\\x99s descendants, and trust 2 is held for the benefit of grandchild 2 and grandchild 2â\\x80\\x99s descendants. grandchild 1 has five children, great-grandchild 1, great-grandchild 2, great-grandchild 3, greatgrandchild 4, and great-grandchild 5. grandchild 2 has one child, great-grandchild 6. neither grandchild 1 nor grandchild 2 has any deceased children. trustees serve as trustees of trust 1. trust 1 is the subject of this ruling request. section 9(a) of trust 1 provides that trustees may distribute the net income of trust 1 to or for the benefit of grandchild 1 and grandchild 1â\\x80\\x99s descendants in such proportions and at such times as trustees determine is desirable or necessary, considering their needs, best interests, and other sources of income, or may annually accumulate and add all or part of the net income to the principal of trust 1. section 9(b) of trust 1 provides that trustees may distribute the principal of trust 1 to or for the benefit of grandchild 1 and grandchild 1â\\x80\\x99s descendants in such proportions plr-110419-22 3 and at such times as trustees determine is desirable or necessary for their medical care, comfortable maintenance, education, or general support and welfare, considering their other resources. section 9(c) of trust 1 provides that trust 1 will terminate 21 years after the death of the survivor of grandchild 1 and grandchild 2, and the principal of trust 1 will be distributed to grandchild 1â\\x80\\x99s descendants, per stirpes. if, however, grandchild 1 and grandchild 1â\\x80\\x99s descendants all die before that date, trust 1 will terminate early, and the principal of trust 1 will be distributed to trust 2. summary: - grandparent died and left the residue of his estate to trust 1 and trust 2, testamentary trusts established under will. the trustees of trust 1 want to divide the estate equally between grandchild 1 and grandchild 2. - section 9(a) of trust 1 provides that trustees may distribute the net income to grandchild 1 and grandchild 1\\'s descendants in any proportion they determine is desirable. - section 9(b) of trust 1 provides that trustees may distribute principal to grandchild 1 and grandchild 1\\'s descendants as they determine is desirable. - section 9(c) of trust 1 provides that if grandchild 1 and grandchild 1\\'s descendants all die before 21 years, trust 1 will terminate early. ## you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary maintains formal terms. letter: dear [name], this letter ruling is in response to a request from your authorized representative dated march 11, 2022, and subsequent documentation requesting an extension of an additional five years under internal revenue code (â\\x80\\x9circâ\\x80\\x9d) section 4943(c)(7) for disposing of certain excess business holdings. taxpayer represents the facts as follows. facts taxpayer was incorporated as a state nonprofit corporation. taxpayer is exempt from federal income tax under irc section 501(a) as an organization described in irc section 501(c)(3) and is classified as a private foundation under irc section 509(a). taxpayer was created by individuals to support the domestic and international community and various charitable organizations. individuals were substantial contributors to taxpayer within the meaning of irc section 507(d)(2), and therefore disqualified persons with respect to taxpayer under irc section 4946(a)(1)(a). as a result of individualsâ\\x80\\x99 death, taxpayer received a shares of entity 1 common voting stock from trust, a disqualified person, on date 1, which taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. additionally, on date 2, granddaughter, who is the granddaughter of one of the individuals, and who serves as a co-trustee of taxpayer, received a testamentary disposition from trust of b shares of entity 1 common voting stock. granddaughter is also a disqualified person under irc section 4946. the combined shares of taxpayer and granddaughter represent approximately c percent of entity 1â\\x80\\x99s outstanding capital stock and are a minority interest in entity 1. as a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the a shares, taxpayer has excess business holdings of entity 1 under irc section 4943(c)(1). on date 3, also as a result of individualsâ\\x80\\x99 death, taxpayer received from trust an approximate z percent membership interest in entity 2, an llc, which taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. as a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the llc membership interest, which is a minority interest, taxpayer has excess business holdings of entity 2 under irc section 4943(c)(1). summary: - a taxpayer requested an extension of five years under irc section 4943(c)(7) for disposing of certain excess business holdings. - a testamentary gift of stock to taxpayer and a testamentary disposition to granddaughter, both disqualified persons, resulted in taxpayer having excess business holdings of entity 1 under irc section 4943(c)(1). - on date 3, taxpayer received an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest of an llc membership interest, which is an excess business holding. ## you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary maintains formal terms. letter: dear [name], this letter responds to a letter dated march 15, 2022, submitted on behalf of s corporation target, purchaser, and shareholder (collectively, the \"parties\"), requesting an extension of time under â§301.9100-3 of the procedure and administration regulations to file an election. the parties are requesting an extension of time to file the election statement under â§1.336-2(h)(3)(iii) of the income tax regulations (the \"election statement\") with respect to purchaser\\'s acquisition of all the stock of s corporation target from shareholder on date 1. the material information submitted is summarized below. on date 1, purchaser acquired all the stock of s corporation target from shareholder (the \"stock disposition\"). it has been represented that the stock disposition qualified as a \"qualified stock disposition\" as defined in â§1.336-1(b)(6). the parties intended to make a section 336(e) election for the stock disposition but, for various reasons, a timely election was not fully made. subsequently, this request was submitted, under â§301.9100-3, for an extension of time to file the election statement. the parties each represented that they are not seeking to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related penalty has been or could be imposed under section 6662. regulations promulgated under section 336(e) permit certain sales, exchanges, or distributions of stock of a corporation to be treated as asset dispositions if: (1) the disposition is a \"qualified stock disposition\" as defined in â§1.336-1(b)(6); and (2) a section 336(e) election is made. summary: and the completion: - the parties requested an extension of time under â§301.9100-3 of the procedure and administration regulations to file an election. - the parties are requesting an extension of time to file the election statement with respect to purchaser\\'s acquisition of all the stock of s corporation target from shareholder on date 1. - the parties represented that they are not seeking to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related penalty has been or could be imposed under section 6662. ## notes it is wise to try several phrasings for your prompt. you can, for instance, keep it simple and direct by writing: summarize the following part of a legal letter while maintaining formal terms. letter: [letter] summary: alternatively, you can take a more elaborate approach, such as: you are legalai, an ai legal assistant that excels at summarizing legal documents. below you will find part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary maintains formal terms. letter: [letter] summary: as you can see, we are providing the model with several examples, separated by a stop sequence, which is easily spotted while reading the text. you can read more about stop sequences here . because this task requires high accuracy, we recommend working at a low temperature. it\\'s best to explore the range of 0.0-0.3, since temperature 0 does tend to produce short summaries. you can read more about temperature here . you can test several options for the prompt in our playground. there is a consistent structure to all the examples in the prompt. this few-shot prompt can be created using the following code (assuming you have the paragraphs and summaries): def make_single_example(letter, summary):\\n    example = \"you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary maintains formal terms.\\\\n\"\\n    example += \"letter:\\\\n\"\\n    example += letter\\n    example += \"\\\\n\"\\n    example += \"summary:\\\\n\"\\n    example += summary\\n    \\n    return example\\n\\n# this is the stop sequence\\nseparator = \"\\\\n##\\\\n\"\\n\\nfew_shot_prefix = separator.join(\\n    make_single_example(letter, summary) for letter, summary in zip(letters, summaries)\\n)\\n\\ndef make_few_shot_prompt(letter):\\n    \\n    return few_shot_prefix + separator + make_single_example(letter, \\'\\') # keep the summary empty and let the model complete summarize for the average joe despite the fact that there are over 1.3 million lawyers in the united states alone, most peopleâ\\xa0 (still) aren\\'t lawyers and have trouble understanding legal documents. in this case, we probably want the summary to be written in a simple, easy-to-understand manner. as this task involves both summarizing and simplifying texts, it is inherently more difficult. thus, we will probably need more \"shots\" in our few-shot prompt (in this case, we added another example to the prompt). here is an example of a few-shot prompt: you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary is short and written in simple words. letter: dear [name], this letter responds to your authorized

distributed to trust 2. summary: the purpose of this letter is to describe a trust set up by a grandparent for the benefit of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren. the trustees may distribute money from the trust, but they must follow certain rules. after 21 years, the trust will end, and the remaining money will be distributed to the main beneficiary\\'s descendants. if all the descendants of the main beneficiary pass away before then, the remaining money will be transferred to another trust. ## you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize

taxpayer, received a testamentary disposition from trust of b shares of entity 1 common voting stock. granddaughter is also a disqualified person under irc section 4946. the combined shares of taxpayer and granddaughter represent approximately c percent of entity 1â\\x80\\x99s outstanding capital stock and are a minority interest in entity 1. as a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the a shares, taxpayer has excess business holdings of entity 1 under irc section 4943(c)(1). on date 3, also as a result of individualsâ\\x80\\x99 death, taxpayer received from trust an approximate z percent membership interest in entity 2, an llc, which taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. as a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the llc membership interest, which is a minority interest, taxpayer has excess business holdings of entity 2 under irc section 4943(c)(1). summary: a nonprofit organization asks for more time to sell extra stocks it received after the deaths of a few key contributors. nonprofit organizations have a limit on how many stocks they can keep, so they request an extension to get rid of them. ## you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary is short and written in simple words. letter: dear [name], this letter responds to a letter dated march 15,

prompt is not sufficient. by adding another example (\"shot\"), however, we will get much better results. below you can see the completion: a corporation asks the government for more time to file a statement related to its financial performance for a specific tax year. the government has granted the request but may check the information provided by the company later.<br> ## notes: like in the previous case, you should try several phrasings for your prompt. you can test several options for the prompt in our playground . alternatively, you could have summarized for lawyers first, and then simplified the summary (using a different prompt). this method may, however, result in some information being lost. summary in this post, we explore the use-case of summarization. if you need a simple, off-the-shelf summarizer, be sure to check out our specialized summarization api . however, for more specific use-cases and customization, itâ\\x80\\x99s wise to get closer to the core with the help of large language models, as custom models that are tailored to your specific needs will always get you higher quality results. click here to learn more. about the author yuval belfer enjoyed

standing on the shoulders of giant language models contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that\\'s it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it\\'s your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly. name * email * message * thank you!

       "  'text': \"how latitude scaled production of their gaming worlds while reducing costs case study how latitude scaled production of their gaming worlds while reducing costs ai21 labs managed to build enterprise-level production models which served players at latitude to elevate the gaming experience while at the same time improving cost. latitude is a pioneer in the ai gaming space, offering powerful ai-generated digital gamescapes for its players. latitude is most famously known for ai dungeon, a text-based adventure game that uses artificial intelligence to generate unique and unpredictable stories, depending on the choices that a player makes. in the past, computer adventure games were limited in terms of the amount of actions and scenarios they offered. by using large language models, ai dungeon grants players the flexibility to perform virtually any action and have the game respond to that action.â example from ai dungeon latitude got good traction with its early implementation of ai dungeon on top of gpt-3, but when planning their future roadmap, they quickly realized that they needed an llm partner who shared their vision of immersive ai-driven experiences. they found an eager partner in ai21 labs, who worked collaboratively with latitude to discover roadblocks and brainstorm solutions. this resulted in improvements to issues such as latency, flexibility, and user satisfaction, to name just a few. so, how did they do it? ai21 labs managed to build enterprise-level production models which served players at latitude to elevate the gaming experience while at the same time improving cost efficiency. latitude found ai21 labs to be a collaborative llm partner, which wasnâ\\x80\\x99t just a plug-and-play solution to a scaling problem, but rather a trusted partner with whom they could collaborate on ai solutions.â but what were the exact problems preventing latitude from realizing its vision? and how did ai21 labs overcome them? read on for the full story. who is latitude? latitude was never envisioned as a gaming company - it actually started as a hackathon project that translated into a dungeons and dragons plugin. the team decided to go to market with the plugin, and within the first week, they had roughly 100,000 customers which quickly grew to a million in just the first month.â the verdict was in: there was a creative use case for large language models for game-like experiences and writing.â\\xa0â searching for a collaborative solutionâ latitude wanted to offer a stronger game experience, with richer text and better ai responses. for this, they partnered with the legacy gpt-3 enterprise, openai.â but with rapidly evolving technology came growing pains, and openai was not aligned with latitude's vision - thus, the visionary gaming experience became impossible. it became clear to latitude that they needed to seek out a new tech partner who was interested in solving the use case of creating an ai-driven adventure role play game.. switching from openai to ai21 labs latitude booked a call with ai21 labs when theyâ\\x80\\x99d just launched their jurassic-1 model. a jurassic prototype was set up for latitude, and they started experimenting with the features and the accuracy of results. the final model was perfect for latitudeâ\\x80\\x99s ai dungeon use case. soon after that, the team declared it an alpha model for their audience. in order to get to that stage, the teams had to overcome two massive roadblocks. the first roadblock: creative restrictionsâ\\xa0â openaiâ\\x80\\x99s policy of non-violence restricted integral elements of latitudeâ\\x80\\x99s ai dungeon adventures â\\x80\\x94 quests, swords, and fights. it was impossible to have a role playing expedition without weapons.â â\\x80\\x9cwe were interested in a partner who understands the nuances of the creative use case.â\\x80\\x9d says ryan seamons, vp of product at latitude.â ryan seamons - vp product @ latitude latitude prioritized finding a partner who was not only aligned philosophically but willing to become a true partner and collaborator in building a quality ai-driven role-play experience. â\\x80\\x9cwe need to offer ai-assisted role-play at scale to thousands of daily players. we need models that are fast, reliable, and creative.â\\x80\\x9d says seamons.â the collaborative opportunity: agilityâ ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99 team of developers, creators, and stakeholders were analytical problem-solvers who created reliable production models for latitude. a precise production model is critical for a gaming company like latitude. it defines the customer experience and determines whether users will come back. so, it needs to be hyper-accurate and reliable. to achieve this, there has to be excellent communication during prototyping. latitude and ai21 labs had a system for rapid back-and-forth between teams and numerous collaborative checkpoints. as a result, they got to the production stage quickly. even after launching the model, the ai21 labs team worked tirelessly to ship updates, create new features, and build on feedback.â â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99ve experimented with other tools, but they have been demanding and daunting with direct orders and no problem-solving. but not ai21 (labs). theyâ\\x80\\x99re enthusiastic, collaborative, and innovative â\\x80\\x94 a true gaming visionary.â\\x80\\x9d says seamons. the second problem: exponential costs latitude offers ai-assisted role-play at scale to thousands of daily players.â not only did latitude want to offer existing models to new players, they also wanted to create more immersive and realistic worlds. they wanted an llm partner who offered customizable pricing because gaming models are extremely expensive to run at scale.â\\xa0â â\\x80\\x9cai costs are one of our most significant ongoing expenses, and so finding ways to reduce our ai costs help us to operate sustainably as a business.â\\x80\\x9d the collaborative opportunity: cost-effectiveness through optimizationâ ai21 labs put in hours of skilled talent to make the large language model efficient enough to be cost-effective. they helped latitude transition from jurassic-1 jumbo to jurassic-1 grande to scale performance at the right cost. jurassic-1 jumbo, ai21â\\x80\\x99s biggest model, processes 178 billion parameters to generate an output. but after running multiple experiments, their team concluded that latitudeâ\\x80\\x99s game did not need this many parameters. they switched from jumbo to grande (which uses 17b parameters), and the result was the perfect sweet spot for a compelling experience at a sustainable price with faster response time. the cost savings are great, but the faster response times are also something players can benefit from. the lower costs also let latitude experiment with additional ways to improve output quality, such as hydra mode which generates multiple responses and selects the best one for a player. being able to experiment with new data sets more quickly and affordably also yielded positive results and will be a major part of latitudeâ\\x80\\x99s ai strategy this year. â\\x80\\x9c the biggest benefit of working with ai21 (labs) is for agile companies who want more hands-on attention in service. what iâ\\x80\\x99ve been most impressed with is the proactiveness in optimizing costs for multiple use cases. itâ\\x80\\x99s been a breath of fresh air compared to competitors.â\\x80\\x9d says seamons. the final results latitude discovered that the grande model struck the right balance of cost vs. performance, all while generating higher quality results than small models such as gpt-j or gpt-3 curie.â by using an ensemble model approach called hydra, latitude was able to achieve quality similar to that of larger models. at every stage, the team at ai21 labs devised innovative solutions to roadblocks and proactively and continuously improved cost efficiency.â whether through large-scale prototyping or improving production after release, latitude found ai21 labs to be a creative, efficient, and reliable partner on every level. about the author enjoyed this? stay up

shoulders of giant language models contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation

harambee youth employment accelerator is a not-for-profit social enterprise that solves youth employment through partnerships. harambee works with partners who are also committed to results that can work at scale â\\x80\\x93 including government, the private sector, civil society, and over three million youth. by fusing brilliant minds with best-in-class technology,â\\xa0harambee is working to unlock jobs and break down the barriers that keep millions of young south africans unemployed. but how they bridge the gap between unemployed with no experience to ready to work and employable is a key reason why harambee eventually needed ai21 studio. harambee put these youth through a simulation of a workplace that they call the â\\x80\\x9cbridging processâ\\x80\\x9d. in it, the individuals report to a manager and are measured on punctuality and soft skills with a scorecard.â â\\x80\\x9cafter three months of daily bridging, they were transformed,â\\x80\\x9d said brent, noting that employers would always see a positive difference in these young adults after completing the program. and then the 2020 pandemic happened.â pivoting their processes, and turning to nlp during a pandemic the once highly personalized, streamlined work socialization experience was now at risk. â\\x80\\x9cwith only 120 personnel at the time, we stopped doing face-to-face processes and didnâ\\x80\\x99t do the bridging anymore,â\\x80\\x9d says brent. like many companies during that time, they went fully remote and launched a new website â\\x80\\x93 sayouth . and while they still had companies wanting to employ these youths, these individuals werenâ\\x80\\x99t yet ready for the job market. â\\x80\\x9cthey were missing the secret sauce [of the bridging process],â\\x80\\x9d adds brent. searching for a solution that could match human intelligence this led them to the development of a chatbot that they called â\\x80\\x9ccoachmeeâ\\x80\\x9d. it created a conversation based learning experience that used evidence-based techniques to effect measurable behavior change in its users. but not without some snags along the way. â\\x80\\x9cfrom our previous work with other chatbots [before finding ai21], we had seen how the signup process was a vital component for ensuring high levels of engagement and most chatbots failed to do that with an audience like ours for a number of reasons,â\\x80\\x9d brent tells us, explaining why he went searching for a new solution. hereâ\\x80\\x99s what harambee needed â\\x80\\x93 and what led them to ai21. problem #1: a chatbot that can understand, not just repeat their focus was deeper than simply having quick response times for their customers. harambee needed help creating trust, rapport, and relationships with their users during their sign-up process â\\x80\\x93 a critical, pivotal moment in their program. â\\x80\\x9ctraditional intent-based nlps are all about understanding what someone says, but then returning something that is prewritten. but no conversation is like that. you must be unique,â\\x80\\x9d says brent, providing us with an example of an everyday conversation during the sign-up process. chatbot: â\\x80\\x9cwelcome to coachmee, please tell me your name.â\\x80\\x9d person: â\\x80\\x9c19547896â\\x80\\x9d chatbot: â\\x80\\x9cthat looks like an id number, would you mind, with respect, telling me your name again?â\\x80\\x9d person: â\\x80\\x9cmy name isâ\\xa0rejoice precious mikateko â\\x80\\x9d chatbot: â\\x80\\x9chello, rejoice!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9calready there, the ability to see someone and get their name right. â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s no traditional intent-based nlp that can do that.â\\x80\\x9d problem #2: adapt to overcome language barriers and context there are many models that offer a multitude of language options, but one was missing â\\x80\\x93 what about broken english?â there are times when people switch between languages and use a mix of words that would not be understood by a normal chatbot. our goal isn\\'t just to find something that speaks one of south africa\\'s 11 official languages, but to find out what someone really is trying to convey.â\\x80\\x9d says brent. why ai21 studio? better accessibility and support while we at ai21 have best practices to help mitigate the risk of malicious use of language models, ai21â\\x80\\x99s barrier to entry was non-existent, meaning harambee could jump right in.â â\\x80\\x9ci was astonished that there was no huge waiting list to get into this platform and i found the company\\'s vision quite inspiring. i signed up and started playing around on the playground.â\\x80\\x9dâ itâ\\x80\\x99s important to be able to interact with the models, explore presets, and play around before committing to an nlp. â\\x80\\x9ci am not a coder,â\\x80\\x9d he adds. â\\x80\\x9cwhen i saw that ai21 studio had an easy-to-use fine-tuning feature that did not require any previous coding experience, i was excited to see how quickly i could prototype different conversational flows and build something that felt human and relatable.â\\x80\\x9d beyond the chatbot: how harambee used ai21 to reach their end goal harambee saw incredible success using the chatbot. â\\x80\\x9cthe conversations [work seekers are having] are incredible,â\\x80\\x9d says brent. â\\x80\\x9cfor the first time, they feel like they are important. for the first time, they feel like their goals are important. they feel like there is someone there to support them.â\\x80\\x9d beyond building rapport and genuine connection with the south african youth, they were able to utilize ai21 to make their jobs easier and improve further processes. solution #1: content creation through â\\x80\\x9clifehacksâ\\x80\\x9d with ai copywriting, you can automate repetitive writing tasks. brent and the harambee team were able to develop around 60 different \"lifehacks\" for users who had signed up for coachmee check-in sessions. lifehacks have to strike a careful balance between being aspirational andâ\\xa0transcendent, while being practical and relevant. all within a few sentences, making sure someone doesn\\'t have to scroll back up to read the full message.â another unique contribution of ai21 labs was around the use of emojis, which enabled the lifehacks to be much more playful and engaging. solution #2: unique reference letters with the summarization tool, you can compress documents and extract key insights into short summaries . brent and the harambee team used this to create 100% unique, relevant reference letters for each individual who finished their training.â â\\x80\\x9csometimes the model can go way too far and make up crazy things about the person,â\\x80\\x9d says brent, discussing what has gone wrong while using other applications.â â\\x80\\x9c[but] when a user completes 20 check-ins with coachmee, we have enough data that can factually testify to someone\\'s commitment to growth and goal-achievement. that information, together with the deep insights into their aspirations and personality that we lifted from the initial sign-up conversation, we are able to use studio api to generate beautiful reference letters that they can attach to their cvs and take with them to interviews,â\\x80\\x9d explains brent. â\\x80\\x9ci [once] got a message saying, â\\x80\\x98i gotta frame this!â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d reference letter - example the result: helping thousand of youths gain employment when they need it mostâ harambee has fine-tuned its ai21 nlp experience to drive meaningful conversations. their data shows that the stronger the rapport that is built at the beginning of the relationship, the more chance the person has at continuing and completing the process. pillar 1 - engagement: most start, most finish brent concludes that â\\x80\\x9ccompared to the first iteration of coachmee which did not use an nlp for the sign-up process, our conversion rate from sign-up to completion has improved by 20%.â\\x80\\x9d in addition, he tells us that almost 1,000 young people have measurably higher prospects of employment thanks to the unique reference letters that ai21 studio api helped create. â\\x80\\x9cai21 has been the most generous, collaborative and supportive technology partner that i have ever worked with.â\\x80\\x9d we are thrilled to have the opportunity to use our nlp technology to help elevate the careers of thousands of youths in africa. we hope this project serves as inspiration to many other organizations around the world. about the author enjoyed this?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that\\'s it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it\\'s your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

       "  'text': 'build a dashboard based on freeform sentiment analysis of hotel reviews tutorial build a dashboard based on freeform sentiment analysis of hotel reviews analyze large quantities of reviews in minutes using ai21 studio imagine that you have a platform for hotel reservations, similar to hotels.com . on your platform, hotel visitors can leave written reviews and an overall star rating for the hotel. these reviews allow hotel owners to gain a general understanding of guest satisfaction through their overall score, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s just one part of the story. the quality of the hotel experience is a combination of many factors, including the room quality, the facilities, and the staff. ideally, the owner would like to get a clear picture of their hotelâ\\x80\\x99s strengths and weaknesses so they can improve on the aspects that are lacking and highlight the aspects that visitors find positive. to extract these insights, some hotel owners sit down from time to time and read all of the reviews that were written about their hotel. this is a tedious task - one you, as a developer, would probably want to spare your users from. what if you could create a dashboard that highlights the areas guests mention positively or negatively in their reviews? as a result, your user - in this case, the hotel owner - can get a real-time snapshot of their strengths and weaknesses with just a glance at this dashboard. not so long ago, you would have needed to work pretty hard to create a solution like that (for example, using several classical methods ). but with large language models (llms), itâ\\x80\\x99s really easy. you can perform this analysis with high accuracy, even with no prior knowledge of natural language processing (nlp). if that sounds appealing to you, then read on. by the end of this post, you will be able to implement this feature in your platform or product. this post will walk you through the process of building an nlp-powered dashboard for a hotel, including: using an external api to gather real-world data. performing freeform combined topic extraction and sentiment analysis using jurassic-1, part of the ai21 studio suite of large language models. generating the output in a convenient format (json) so itâ\\x80\\x99s easier to process. if you are new to large language models, we recommend first reading this post . step 1: collect reviews using an external api you can find the hotels.com api on rapidapi . there are several endpoints to this api. we need the reviews endpoint, that returns the reviews for a given hotel, page-by-page. there are approximately 50 reviews per page. in order to retrieve all of the available reviews we will call the api while iterating through the pages. the following functions do just that: def get_hotel_reviews_page(hotel_id, page_number):\\n    params = {\\n        \"locale\": \"en_us\", \\n        \"hotel_id\": hotel_id, \\n        \"page_number\": str(page_number)\\n    }\\n    headers = {\\n        \"x-rapidapi-key\": rapid_api_key,\\n        \"x-rapidapi-host\": \"hotels-com-provider.p.rapidapi.com\"\\n    }\\n    response = requests.get(url=get_reviews_url, headers=headers, params=params)\\n     \\n    reviews = [\\n        review[\\'summary\\'] \\n        for page_reviews in response.json()[\\'groupreview\\']\\n        for review in page_reviews[\\'reviews\\']\\n    ]\\n    return reviews\\n\\n\\ndef get_hotel_reviews(hotel_id, num_pages):\\n    all_reviews = sum(\\n        [get_hotel_reviews_page(hotel_id, page_number) for page_number in range(1, num_pages + 1)],\\n        start=[]\\n    )\\n    return all_reviews â\\x80\\x8d note that running this function requires an api key for the reviews endpoint, which you can obtain from rapidapi. this is not your ai21 studio api key. there are some edge cases that this function doesnâ\\x80\\x99t cover, such as requesting a page number that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t exist, but weâ\\x80\\x99ll set them aside for the purposes of this blog post. throughout this process, we will use the empire hotel in new york as a running example. you can use an api endpoint to get the hotel id, or you can find it in the hotelâ\\x80\\x99s url on hotels.com: step 2: prepare the reviews data for the language model large language models are very powerful and can ingest text of all shapes and sizes, but as the old saying goes, â\\x80\\x9cgarbage in, garbage outâ\\x80\\x9d. if you feed the model a bad prompt, the results will be far from optimal. in this case, you should keep the following points in mind: reviews that are too short could be problematic since they often do not contain enough information to extract any meaningful insights. currently, our models are limited to the english language only. in order to remove reviews that are too short or not in english, you can apply some simple filters to all of the reviews: from langdetect import detect\\ndef filter_reviews(reviews):\\n    en_reviews = [review for review in reviews if len(review)>=20 and detect(review)==\"en\"]\\n            \\n    return en_reviews â\\x80\\x8d note: here, we have removed reviews that have no real content by applying a very basic filter. although this is not mandatory, we recommend that you pre-process your reviews by, for example, removing weird characters and extra spaces, etc. step 3: extract the categories and sentiments using ai21 studio this step is where you trulyâ\\xa0 harness the power of ai21 studioâ\\x80\\x99s large language models!â you want the model to extract the topics and sentiments of each free text review into a structured json format. you can do this by leveraging a main strength of language models: when provided with text in plain english, the language model can identify patterns and generate text that follows the same pattern. by feeding the model a prompt with a few examples (this is called a few-shot prompt ), it can identify the pattern and generate a reasonably good completion. obtaining these examples, however, requires you to manually go through several reviews, which we have done below. the resulting few-shot prompt is as follows (the reviews are as written by the platformâ\\x80\\x99s users, with no grammar or spelling corrections): review: great experience for two teenagers. we would book again. location good. extracted sentiment: {\"location\": \"positive\"} ## review: extremely old cabinets, phone was half broken and full of dust. bathroom door was broken, bathroom floor was dirty and yellow. bathroom tiles were falling off. asked to change my room and the next room was in the same conditions. the most out of date and least maintained hotel i ever been on. extracted sentiment: {\"cleaning\": \"negative\", \"hotel facilities\": \"negative\", \"room quality\": \"negative\"} ## review: roof topâ\\x80\\x99s view is gorgeous and the lounge area is comfortable. the staff is very courteous and the location is great. the hotel is outdated and the shower need to be clean better. the air condition runs all the time and cannot be control by the temperature control setting. extracted sentiment: {\"cleaning\": \"negative\", \"ac\": \"negative\", \"room quality\": \"negative\", \"service\": \"positive\", \"view\": \"positive\", \"hotel facilities\": \"positive\"} ## creating a good prompt is more than simply deciding on the pattern. the goal is to construct a prompt that triggers the model to generate the optimal completion (this is called prompt engineering ). to achieve this, you should keep the following in mind: variety: the examples in the prompt will determine the modelâ\\x80\\x99s responses for unseen data, so they must be diverse enough to reflect the real-world distribution. this applies to both the structure of the reviews (such as length) and the content (the topics discussed in every review, the sentiments, etc.). be sure to include reviews that are mixed in sentiment (like the third example provided above), as these are usually harder to analyze. amount: how â\\x80\\x9cfewâ\\x80\\x9d examples should our few-shot prompt include? when it comes to this relatively complex task, it is recommended that you provide at least eight different examples in the prompt (depending on the number of topics and the variety within them). the most effective way to determine this is through testing it out in the playground. try it yourself! â additionally, in this use-case, we recommend setting the temperature to 0, as high accuracy is required more than creativity. increasing the temperature will result in more creative results, while lowering the temperature will increase their accuracy. curious about temperature? see step 4 in this post for more detail on this. happy with the prompt and want to start analyzing reviews? you can copy the few-shot prompt from the playground: and use the following function to create the prompt for every review: def create_review_prompt(review):\\n    few_shot_examples = few_shot_examples\\n    prompt = few_shot_examples + review + \"\\\\nextracted sentiment:\\\\n\"\\n    return prompt â\\x80\\x8d for every review, create the prompt and then call jurassic-1 to perform the analysis (you can take the call from the playground, as illustrated above, or use the function from here ). step 4: create the dashboard once you have the list of topics and sentiments, you can create your dashboard. first, gather all of the topics together, assigning a count of \"positive\" or \"negative\" to each topic. since you already have the completion in json format, you can process it using standard packages. however, as the format may not be perfect, and you donâ\\x80\\x99t want any failures in your automated process, you can add a simple try-catch block. this means if a completion from the model isnâ\\x80\\x99t in perfect json format, you drop it. you can use the following function: def get_topk_categories_and_score(sentiments, k=7):\\n    parsed_sentiments = []\\n    for sentiment in sentiments:\\n      try:\\n         parsed_sentiments.append(ast.literal_eval(sentiment))\\n

invest more in the wifi and ac, and perhaps do some renovations or upgrades to the rooms and facilities. as a last step and some sanity check, youâ\\x80\\x99ll probably want to validate your results, but without manually reading every review. one way to do that is to compare them with those of other hotel platforms, such as booking.com. if you go to the booking.com page for this hotel , where visitors are asked to rate hotels across numerous categories, you will find the overall picture is very similar to your own analysis: summary by following the steps laid out in this post, you have built a very useful feature that can be implemented on hotel and accommodation platforms. thanks to large language models, analyzing pieces of text, such as reviews, has never been easier. a few simple tweaks, such as writing the examples in json format, can save a lot of time in post-processing, making the entire process faster and easier. you can find the full notebook in our dev-hub . are

whitepaper paper: standing on the shoulders of giant language models contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that\\'s it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it\\'s your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly. name * email * message * thank you!

not so long ago, the answer to this question was â\\x80\\x98no!â\\x80\\x99. today, thanks to large language models, practitioners with different levels of expertise can build applications that generate useful text for marketing, content writing and more.â hold on tight, because in this blog post weâ\\x80\\x99re going to go from an idea to a completely new text generation feature that you can ship immediately. ready to get started?â motivation suppose you\\'re building a job marketplace app or a personnel recruitment platform. you probably have a feature that lets candidates upload their cv to your system. those cvs aren\\'t always stellar. for example, many of them lack a profile section - a short paragraph that highlights the candidateâ\\x80\\x99s background, skills and ambitions. luckily, you can use ai21 studio to help your users by auto-generating a cv profile for them. this is just one example of short-form content generation, where language models are used to draft text up to a paragraph long (more examples are in the summary). in this post we\\'ll build a cv profile generator that you can integrate into your application or website in just a few minutes of work. step 1: define the problem understanding what kind of text you want to generate is essential. in this case we need to ask ourselves:â\\xa0 what makes a good cv profile that our users will appreciate? letâ\\x80\\x99s take a look at some examples and try to find ones we like. here is an article you can find online that shows various types of cv profiles. for example, letâ\\x80\\x99s look at a profile for a chemical engineer: i am a dedicated, hardworking and proactive chemical engineer with a strong background in design, plant operations, offshore operations, and process and safety improvements. i have solid work experience in designing, testing and analysing processes to increase the overall efficiency of operations. i am currently looking for an opportunity to utilise my technical skills in a challenging working environment and become a valuable asset to the organization that i work for. as you can see, itâ\\x80\\x99s a short paragraph that covers the candidates background, experience and the type of role they are looking for. browsing through more examples, it is clear that most cv profiles follow this pattern. letâ\\x80\\x99s make a note of a few examples (3-5 will do) that we like. our goal is to generate texts similar to these examples. now we are ready to log into the ai21 studio and start building. step 2: create your (initial) prompt language models take in some text as input and generate some likely continuation of that text. we call the input text the prompt and the generated text the completion . you can think of large language models as smart auto-completion algorithms: they are very good at latching on to hints and patterns expressed in plain english, and generating text that follows the same patterns.â for example, if we input a prompt that is likely to be followed by a cv profile, we can get the model to generate new and original cv profiles as completions. one simple way to do this is to spell out an instruction, just like you would when asking a person to produce some text: write a winning teaching cv profile: letâ\\x80\\x99s take this prompt and see what the model will generate. go to the ai21 studio, put this prompt in the input field and click â\\x80\\x9cgeneratedâ\\x80\\x9d. this is the completion the model generated: mr george mwangi is a teacher who has completed diploma, degree and masters degree in education. he has vast teaching experience of 7 years. his expertise is in the field of science, biology, chemistry and physics. he is a hardworking, dedicated candidate with vast experience of teaching various levels, including university students. what do we like about this completion? it matches the profession we provided (teacher).â it contains relevant education and experience. it uses some good adjectives. what do we not like about this completion? this paragraph is written in third person (â\\x80\\x9cmr mwangi isâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d), whereas our good cv profile examples are always written in the first person (â\\x80\\x9ci amâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d). the details the model generated are completely made up - they may or may not reflect our candidates\\' true skills. how can we make the model produce the output we want? you can try to phrase the instruction differently. be descriptive and clear, and try a few different ones, like: following is an exceptional cv profile for a teacher: or here is an enthusiastic teacherâ\\x80\\x99s cv profile: that said, you shouldn\\'t spend too much time on choosing the perfect adjectives.â the most powerful tool you have at your disposal is providing examples that demonstrate what you expect from the model. this is the most effective way to guide the generations according to your intentions, and if you have time to do only one thing - this is it. in this case, we already collected some relevant examples in step 1. all thatâ\\x80\\x99s left is to create the prompt from instruction-profile pairs. below you can find a prompt we made by stringing together a sequence of examples we liked. the bold text is the completion our model generated. write a winning sales/retail cv profile: i am a mature, positive and hardworking individual, who always strives to achieve the highest standard possible, at any given task. in my previous role as a sales representative, i demonstrated the ability to work under intense pressure, sell products and services to customers from all backgrounds, handle customer complaints and solve problematic situations as and when they arose. i was promoted twice for exceeding my sales targets. ## write a winning teaching cv profile: i am a loyal, talented and caring teacher who loves making a difference in the lives of young children. i am open-minded, patient and supportive towards other people, especially towards children or those who suffer from disabilities. in my previous role as a primary school teacher, i have taught and nurtured more than 100 pupils from all backgrounds, successfully preparing them for the next stages of their young lives. ## write a winning media cv profile: i am a professional, ambitious and highly skilled camera operator able to use a wide range of technical equipment, including professional cinematography camcorders. i have extensive experience working on a number of television and theatre projects, demonstrating an ability to follow artistic direction and the physical capability required on a professional production set. i am comfortable filming on-location and outside the studio with some previous work experience in live broadcasting. ## write a winning software engineer cv profile: i am a highly talented software engineer with extensive experience of developing complex software systems. i have excellent analytical and problem-solving skills, which allow me to quickly identify and resolve problems. i am self-motivated, able to work on my own initiative and as part of a team. i have excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, and i am able to communicate effectively with people from a wide range of backgrounds. ## did we solve all the problems? well, the profile is written in first person, just like we wanted. unfortunately, it still contains made up details. we solve this in the following section. there are a couple of important things to note here: the instruction we chose was â\\x80\\x9cwrite a winning â\\x80¦ cv profile:â\\x80\\x9d. itâ\\x80\\x99s good to be consistent and use the exact same phrasing throughout the examples in the prompt. each cv profile ends with a pair of hashes, which establishes a pattern for the model to follow. as a result, when the model produces a new cv profile in the completion, it generates â\\x80\\x98##â\\x80\\x99 after it. we can use this signal to detect that the entire profile has been written and terminate the generation using the stop sequence parameter . want to see the generation or check another profile? try it yourself in our playground . step 3: add personalization to your prompt the prompt we have at this point produces well-formatted, impressive-sounding cv profiles for specific roles. you can try it in the playground and see that itâ\\x80\\x99s pretty reliable. each time we generate a new text, we get a random profile for a candidate for the desired role.â although the profiles fit the role, they may be inconsistent with the candidates\\' actual skills, experience and ambitions. you probably want to provide your users a way to guide the generated profile to stick to the facts that are true for them. one way to do it is to inject specific features that you want to be reflected in the profile into the instruction. we took the prompt from the previous section and tweaked it to include â\\x80\\x9cfeaturesâ\\x80\\x9d. we extracted them manually from the examples we gathered earlier. this is the completion generated by the model: write a winning business management cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. logical mind 2. problem solver 3. 2 years of experience in management 4. eager to learn profile: i have a clear, logical mind with a practical approach to problem-solving and a drive to see things through to completion. i have more than 2 years of experience in managing and leading teams across multiple sectors. i am eager to learn, i enjoy overcoming challenges, and i have a genuine interest in business management and making organisations successful. ## write a winning it cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. experience it professional 2. record designing websites, networking and managing databases 3. excellent interpersonal skills 4. looking for a challenge profile: i am a highly competent it professional with a proven track record in designing websites, networking and managing databases. i have strong technical skills as well as excellent interpersonal skills, enabling me to interact with a wide range of clients. i am eager to be challenged in order to grow and further improve my it skills. my greatest passion is in life is using my technical know-how to benefit other people and organisations. ## write a winning sales executive cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. energetic and ambitious 2. 6 years of selling experience 3. love working in a team 4. independent 5. mba from stanford profile: i am an energetic and ambitious sales executive with 6 years of selling experience. i am a team player, but i am also able to work on my own initiative. i am an mba from stanford, and i am looking for a challenging position where i can use my sales skills to benefit an organisation. ## you can see that now we can direct the model to include specific skills and experience! want to see how your features turn into a profile? try here . when working with prompts like these, it is critical to maintain a strong correlation between the features and the generation. if an example\\'s output mentions facts that totally contradict the input or are completely original and unrelated, the model will follow suit and have a tendency to make up things. we call this phenomenon â\\x80\\x9challucinationsâ\\x80\\x9d. on the other hand, if you omit certain features from an example\\'s output, the model will imitate this and occasionally drop some of the provided features. to understand that, letâ\\x80\\x99s take a look at the following bad example (do not try this at home!): write a winning business manager cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. creative person 2. experience in management 3. have an mba from stanford profile: i have a clear, logical mind with a practical approach to problem-solving and a drive to see things through to completion. i have more than 2 years of experience in managing and leading teams across multiple sectors. i am eager to learn, i enjoy overcoming challenges, and i have a genuine interest in business management and making organisations successful. ## write a winning it manager cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. experience it professional 2. record designing websites, networking and managing databases 3. excellent interpersonal skills 4. looking for a challenge profile: having 3 years experience in all aspects of it, including web design, networking, databases and technical support. i am looking for a new challenge. i thrive in challenging environments and i am committed to high standards in all aspects of my work. ## a single example (business manager) was fed into the model here, but there is some mismatch between some skills and the profile. the table below shows both phenomena in this example: what was wrong with the prompt, and how it affected the completion. prompt (business manager) completion (it manager) hallucination 2 years of experience 3 years of experience omission creativity, mba interpersonal skills â\\x80\\x8d step 4: explore the parameters another way to affect the completion is to adjust some of the generation parameters. there are quite a few parameters and you can learn about them here . for now, let\\'s focus on one of the most significant parameters: temperature.â the temperature controls creativity. increasing the temperature tends to result in more varied and creative completions, whereas decreasing it produces more stable and repetitive completions. with temperature set to zero, the model will always generate the most probable completion for a given prompt (which will be the same completion every time). below are examples of three different generations using the same prompt from the previous step:â temperature completion 0 i am an energetic and ambitious sales executive with 6 years of selling experience. i am a team player, but i am also able to work on my own initiative. i am an mba from stanford, and i am looking for a challenging position where i can use my sales skills to benefit an organisation. 0.7 i am ambitious, energetic and hard-working. over the last 6 years, i have gained valuable experience in selling products and services to businesses and consumers. i possess strong communication and presentation skills and i am a team player. i am good at building relationships with clients and i am known for my integrity and honesty. i am currently studying for an mba from stanford. i am confident that i can build a successful career in sales. 1 i am an extremely ambitious and energetic individual with 6 years of selling experience. i have a strong business administration degree, along with an mba from stanford, which has increased my market knowledge. i am a team player who thrives in challenging environments and relishes the opportunity to work autonomously. want to see more results? try it yourself in the playground! step 5: integrate with your code after you\\'ve finished building your prompt and you are happy with the results you see in the playground, you\\'d want to integrate some code to call the ai21 studio api in your product. you can click the api button and copy the necessary code snippet. the request includes your api key (which is linked to your account), certain parameters, and more importantly - the prompt. in production the prompt will need to end with a different input every time we generate a completion, corresponding to the role and the candidate features. we\\'ll need to write a bit of code that injects this into our prompt. here\\'s how you would do it in python: def create_prompt(role, highlights):\\n    \"\"\"\\n        arguments:\\n        - role         : what is the profession of the candidate\\n        - highlights   : what are the skills and ambitions of the candidate\\n\\n        returns:\\n        - prompt       : a full prompt, including few shot examples\\n    \"\"\"\\n    \\n    few_shot_prompt = #paste here the few shot prompt, ends with the stop sequence#\\n    current_input = f\"write a winning {role} incorporating the following features:\\\\n\"\\n    skills_str = \"\"\\n    for i in range(len(highlights)):\\n        skills_str += f\"{i + 1:d}. {highlights[i]}\\\\n\"\\n    skills_str += \"\\\\nprofile:\"\\n\\n    return few_shot_prompt + current_input + skills_str check out this notebook for more details. summary in this post, we have explored the process of going from an idea to an implementation of a short-form text generation feature with ai21 studio. other examples of short-form text that you can generate with ai21 studio are tweets , online ads , product descriptions and more. creating a good prompt is a process that involves some trial and error, but it doesn\\'t require a phd in ai. so don\\'t give up if your first attempt fails to produce good results. look for good examples and keep iterating! â\\x80\\x8d about the author yuval belfer enjoyed this?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella?

       "  'text': 'best practices for deploying language models tutorial best practices for deploying language models cohere, openai, and ai21 labs have developed a preliminary set of best practices applicable to any organization developing or deploying large language models computers that can read and write are here, and they have the potential to fundamentally impact daily life. the future of human-machine interaction is full of possibility and promise, but any powerful technology needs careful deployment. the joint statement below represents a step towards building a community to address the global challenges presented by ai progress, and we encourage other organizations who would like to participate to get in touch. joint recommendation for language model deployment weâ\\x80\\x99re recommending several key principles to help providers of large language models (llms) mitigate the risks of this technology in order to achieve its full promise to augment human capabilities. while these principles were developed specifically based on our experience with providing llms through an api, we hope they will be useful regardless of release strategy (such as open-sourcing or use within a company). we expect these recommendations to change significantly over time because the commercial uses of llms and accompanying safety considerations are new and evolving. we are actively learning about and addressing llm limitations and avenues for misuse, and will update these principles and practices in collaboration with the broader community over time. weâ\\x80\\x99re sharing these principles in hopes that other llm providers may learn from and adopt them, and to advance public discussion on llm development and deployment. prohibit misuse publish usage guidelines and terms of use of llms in a way that prohibits material harm to individuals, communities, and society such as through spam, fraud, or astroturfing. usage guidelines should also specify domains where llm use requires extra scrutiny and prohibit high-risk use-cases that arenâ\\x80\\x99t appropriate, such as classifying people based on protected characteristics. build systems and infrastructure to enforce usage guidelines . this may include rate limits, content filtering, application approval prior to production access, monitoring for anomalous activity, and other mitigations. mitigate unintentional harm proactively mitigate harmful model behavior . best practices include comprehensive model evaluation to properly assess limitations, minimizing potential sources of bias in training corpora, and techniques to minimize unsafe behavior such as through learning from human feedback. document known weaknesses and vulnerabilities , such as bias or ability to produce insecure code, as in some cases no degree of preventative action can completely eliminate the potential for unintended harm. documentation should also include model and use-case-specific safety best practices.â thoughtfully collaborate with stakeholders build teams with diverse backgrounds and solicit broad input. diverse perspectives are needed to characterize and address how language models will operate in the diversity of the real world, where if unchecked they may reinforce biases or fail to work for some groups. publicly disclose lessons learned regarding llm safety and misuse in order to enable widespread adoption and help with cross-industry iteration on best practices. treat all labor in the language model supply chain with respect . for example, providers should have high standards for the working conditions of those reviewing model outputs in-house and hold vendors to well-specified standards (e.g. ensuring labelers are able to opt out of a given task). as llm providers, publishing these principles represents a first step in collaboratively guiding safer large language model development and deployment. we are excited to continue working with each other and with other parties to identify other opportunities to reduce unintentional harms from and prevent malicious use of language models. support from other organizations â\\x80\\x9cwhile llms hold a lot of promise, they have significant inherent safety issues which need to be worked on. these best practices serve as an important step in minimizing the harms of these models and maximizing their potential benefits.â\\x80\\x9d - anthropicâ â\\x80\\x9cas large language models (llms) have become increasingly powerful and expressive, risk mitigation becomes increasingly important. we welcome these and other efforts to proactively seek to mitigate harms and highlight to users areas requiring extra diligence. the principles outlined here are an important contribution to the global conversation.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x93 john bansemer, director of the cyberai project and senior fellow, center for security and emerging technology (cset) \"google affirms the importance of comprehensive strategies in analyzing model and training data to mitigate the risks of harm, bias, and misrepresentation. it is a thoughtful step taken by these ai providers to promote the principles and documentation towards ai safety.\" -

       "  'text': \"introducing j1-grande! announcements introducing j1-grande! ai21 studio releases grande, a high-quality, affordable language model at the convenient size of 17b parameters. during the past few weeks, we've been quietly test-driving grande with ai21 studio users. the feedback was incredible. in fact, while grande is significantly closer in size to j1-large (7.5b parameters), a great majority of users have found that j1-grandeâ\\x80\\x99s quality is comparable to that of j1-jumbo (178b parameters). this is great news for all budget-conscious practitioners; j1-grande, our mid-size model, offers access to supreme quality text generation at a more affordable rate.â check it out: we asked each of the jurassic-1 models to generate a humorous poem about a friendship between a dog and a cat: youâ\\x80\\x99ll find that while each of the three models composed comical (though quite meaningful) poems, grande and jumbo exhibit a far more sophisticated level of writing. try it out for yourself in the ai21 studio playground. with a response time twice as fast as jumbo, at one-third the cost of jumbo, grande delivers an excellent combination of price, quality and speed to even the most seemingly complex use-cases. to learn more about subscription plans, visit the pricing page . â\\x80\\x8d benchmarks distilling the quality of a language model into a single metric is notoriously difficult. nevertheless, we find it helpful to compare the performance of different models on standard nlp tasks. below we examine the accuracy of j1-large, j1-grande and j1-jumbo on a diverse selection of tasks, including common knowledge question answering, reading comprehension and common sense.â\\xa0â none of the models were trained specifically for the tasks presented. we compared the models in two distinct circumstances:â few-shot: demonstrating with a few examples of ideal outputs for it to mimic (as seen here ) zero-shot: void of any guidance whatsoever (as seen here ). data indicates the average accuracy of the broad range of tasks assigned to the jurassic-1 models in experiments of both zero-shot and few-shot.zero-shot trials included arc-challenge, arc-easy, boolq, hellaswag, piqa, race-high, race-middle, rte, storycloze, and winogrande. few-shot trails included arc-challenge, arc-easy, openbookqa, boolq, rte, storycloze and winogrande. all tasks were posed in a multiple-choice format. see jurassic-1 white paper for more details. the perplexity (ppl) of jurassic-1 models is illustrated by average log-probabilities per byte, where a higher number is a more impressive figure. the zero-shot and few-shot findings correspond to the same circumstances and data in the bar graph above. â\\x80\\x8d learn more at https://www.ai21.com/studio or try it yourself in the playground . about the author enjoyed this?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

application in ai21 studio and grow it from prototype to production using custom jurassic-1 models introduction in this blogpost, we walk through a case study demonstrating how you can build production-grade language applications quickly and effortlessly using ai21 studio. we use a simple text classification use-case as our guiding example, but the same process can be applied to a wide variety of language tasks. we start by introducing the task and implementing a baseline solution using prompt engineering with jurassic-1. although prompt engineering is a quick and straightforward method for building a proof-of-concept, it has some key limitations, which we highlight in detail below. to address these limitations, we implement a better solution by training a custom model specifically for our example task. ai21 studioâ\\x80\\x99s custom models are tailored for optimal performance on a given task and can be economically scaled-up to serve production traffic. even more importantly, custom models are easy to set up and use! custom models in ai21 studio require remarkably little data for training ; most tasks can be addressed successfully by training a model on as few as 50-100 examples. this dramatically lowers the entry barrier for training a state-of-the-art language model of your own, to power your app with excellent quality results. your trained custom model is served in ai21 studio and it is immediately available for use, making integration in your application as easy as performing an api query. our example task: classifying news article topics as a guiding example throughout this blogpost, we will use a well known natural language processing (nlp) task: classifying the topics of news articles. specifically, we follow the ag news task formulation, where articles are classified based on their title and their summary into one of four categories: â\\x80\\x9cworldâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9csportsâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cbusinessâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cscience and technologyâ\\x80\\x9d. for example, consider the following sample of three examples from the ag news training set: examples of news article titles and summaries from the agâ\\xa0news training set, first introduced by zhang et al (2015) and available online here . the correct labels for examples 1-3 above are â\\x80\\x9cbusinessâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9csportsâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cworldâ\\x80\\x9d, respectively. prompt engineering solution jurassic-1 language models are trained to predict likely continuations for a piece of input text, called a â\\x80\\x9cpromptâ\\x80\\x9d. we will use this ability to our advantage, by feeding the model with manually crafted prompts that give rise to a specific behavior in the model output; in our case, weâ\\x80\\x99d like the model to output correct labels for articles. the practice of composing a suitable prompt for a specific task is commonly referred to as â\\x80\\x9cprompt engineeringâ\\x80\\x9d . a common and effective prompt engineering approach is to construct a prompt containing a sequence of correctly labeled examples, often called a â\\x80\\x9cfew-shot promptâ\\x80\\x9d . the goal of a few-shot prompt is to cause the model to latch on to the correct relation between inputs (for our task - title and summary) and outputs (topic label). we built a few-shot prompt for our use-case according to best practices, as described in detail in the appendix . we measured the accuracy of predictions on the ag news test set, while varying the number of examples in the prompt. the results are reported in the table below. note that as we increase the number of examples, the models tend to perform better. this is typically the case with few-shot prompts. using j1-jumbo, we reach a respectable accuracy of 86% for a 16-example prompt. ag news test set accuracy for jurassic-1 models using prompt engineering while varying the number of examples in the prompt. why go beyond prompt engineering? we were able to get impressive performance on our task with a very simple method and a tiny dataset of 16 examples (4 per class). this is excellent, but there are several reasons not to be content with our prompt engineering-based solution. first and most obvious, few-shot prompts can become rather long as the number of examples is increased. this means that on each new prediction the model must read and process the entire prompt, increasing the compute time and resulting in higher latency, energy consumption and cost per prediction. since adding examples to the prompt improves accuracy considerably, we are left with an inconvenient tradeoff between quality and cost, making it challenging to serve production-scale traffic with prompt engineering-based solutions. furthermore, language models have a maximum allowed input length. jurassic-1 models can handle up to 2048 tokens (or roughly 2300-2500 english words), counting both the prompt and the generated text. although impressive, this might not be enough in many cases. imagine if instead of using a short summary of an article, we wanted to use the full article body as the input to our topic classification task. in such a case it would be hard to fit more than 1 or 2 examples into the prompt, so we wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have even one example per topic (recall we want to distinguish between 4 topics). alternatively, had we needed to categorize article summaries into one of 100 potential topics, we would have had a similar problem. even if we make the most out of prompt engineering, we may require even better accuracy. suppose we wanted to break the 90% barrier; judging by our results so far, this might be a tall order for prompt engineering. finally, we note that custom models have safety advantages. since they are trained to perform a particular task, it is harder for a malicious user to abuse access to a custom model. we give an example of this in the appendix . in the next section we introduce custom models as a more precise, scalable and cost-effective alternative to prompt engineering, which allows us to overcome the limitations described above. custom model solution custom models are specialized versions of the general purpose models which we have been using so far, trained to deliver optimal results on a given task. by combining our powerful jurassic-1 language models with our special training techniques, ai21 studio allows you to train a capable model using only a small amount of data, and makes it very easy to query your model once itâ\\x80\\x99s trained. to train a custom model of your own, all you need to do is provide us with a small dataset of correctly solved examples, and we will do the rest. the quality of results you get from a custom model depends on the amount and the quality of training data you provide. as a starting point for most tasks, we recommend using 50-100 examples, since we find this is often enough to achieve great results. so, if you can get your hands on a few dozen examples, we recommend you try our custom models. even if you donâ\\x80\\x99t have data at all, we have a few tricks you can use - see the appendix for more details. to pick up where we left our topic classification case study, we trained custom models for ag news while varying the number of examples in the training set. the resulting accuracy on the ag news test set is shown in the table below. as you can see, with as few as 10 examples our custom modelâ\\x80\\x99s accuracy is comparable to j1-large with a few-shot prompt. we also see that adding more training examples results in better accuracy for our custom model, surpassing j1-jumboâ\\x80\\x99s few-shot performance with only 80 training examples. ag news test set accuracy for custom jurassic-1 models trained on datasets varying in size. custom models really start to shine when we take latency into consideration. feeding the general purpose j1-jumbo model with an engineered prompt consisting of 16 examples, we got an accuracy of 86%, and the typical processing time in this case is ~250 milliseconds. a custom model that matches or exceeds this accuracy only needs to process the summary and title of the individual example weâ\\x80\\x99re labeling; there is no need to include a lengthy prompt in every request, because the task-specific behavior is already baked into the model. as a consequence, our custom model can process a typical request in less than 50 milliseconds, offering a greater than 5x speedup compared to prompt engineering . appendix: engineering the prompt an easy way to start engineering a prompt is to feed the model with simple instructions for the required task, such as the following: to predict the label for a given article, we could input the text above followed by the article title, its summary, and a heading that prompts the model to output the correct label as a completion. the full prompt using this scheme follows below. we can replace the text highlighted in blue with the relevant title and summary for any inference example weâ\\x80\\x99d like to label and let the model generate a continuation after â\\x80\\x9cthe topic of this article is:â\\x80\\x9d. this is commonly referred to as a â\\x80\\x9czero-shot promptâ\\x80\\x9d , because the model is expected to correctly perform the task without feeding it any correctly solved example. using the prompt above, j1-large has an accuracy of 32% and j1-jumbo gets 56.9% on the ag news test set; although significantly better than a random guess accuracy, this leaves much to be desired. the zero-shot approach can be improved upon by adding a number of correctly labeled examples to the prompt itself, making it a â\\x80\\x9c few-shot promptâ\\x80\\x9d . jurassic-1 models recognize and imitate patterns in text, so including a few solved examples in the prompt helps reinforce the desired relation between inputs (title and summary) and outputs (topic label); this usually improves prediction accuracy. a few-shot prompt using the sample of three articles above is shown below. as in the zero-shot case, it will end with the inference example specified in the same uniform format, so the text highlighted in blue will be replaced with the appropriate content for the inference example. once weâ\\x80\\x99ve decided on a prompt format as above, we can simply make a longer prompt by adding more examples in the same format. there are some considerations we should keep in mind while doing this: keep the examples relatively balanced between the classes (i.e. the 4 possible topics), to avoid biasing the model towards the more common classes in the prompt. scramble the order of the examples to avoid the model latching on to the wrong pattern (e.g. â\\x80\\x9cbusinessâ\\x80\\x9d always comes after â\\x80\\x9cworldâ\\x80\\x9d in the examples). make sure thereâ\\x80\\x99s enough room for the example you actually want to predict. jurassic-1 models are restricted to 2048 tokens, which should include the prompt and the generated output (1-2 tokens in our case). we built a prompt corresponding to these guidelines. the resulting accuracy for varying prompt lengths is reported above. not surprisingly, the best results are achieved with j1-jumbo and the longest (16-example) prompt, reaching an accuracy 86% on the ag news test set. appendix: safety advantages of custom models ai21 labs is committed to promoting safety in our products. one potential safety risk is deliberate misuse by malicious users of your application, exploiting its access to jurassic-1 to generate text for their malicious purposes. adversaries may attempt to achieve this via â\\x80\\x9cprompt injectionâ\\x80\\x9d , where the end-userâ\\x80\\x99s input text is crafted to alter the normal behavior of the model. as we will now demonstrate, custom models are less susceptible to such attacks than general-purpose models, offering a significant safety advantage when deployed in production. consider a malicious user who has access to the news article topic classification system built on top of jurassic-1 and wishes to abuse it to extract toxic generations from the model. recall that an engineered prompt for topic classification ends with the following text: where <title> and <summary> are user inputs. a malicious user may attempt a prompt injection attack by providing the adversarial input â\\x80\\x9cthe topic of this article is:â\\x80\\x9d followed by some offensive text in place of a legitimate summary, hoping that the model will generate the offensive text or something related to it as the completion. since language models latch on to patterns, the malicious user may even repeat this input line a few times to increase their chances of success. for example, below the adversarial input is repeated 3 times: the figures below compare the performance of the solutions described in this blog post - prompt engineering versus custom models - when faced with an attack like this. we see that the outcome depends on the number of repetitions of the toxic text in the input. for prompt engineering, if the adversary introduces 2 or more repetitions of the toxic text, 50% of the model outputs are toxic, and 3 or more repetitions cause the model to exclusively generate toxic outputs. for custom models, it takes 4 or more repetitions for the adversary to successfully extract toxic generations from the model, and even then the probability of a toxic output is much lower than for prompt engineering. percentage of examples in the ag news test set for which a prompt injection attack successfully generates toxic outputs. left - prompt engineering-based solution with a 16-example prompt. right - custom model solution trained on 3200 examples. the horizontal axis shows the number of times the toxic text (shown above) was repeated in the adversarial input. greedy decoding (temperature=0) was used for generating from both models although using a custom model doesnâ\\x80\\x99t eliminate the risk entirely in this example, it does decrease it substantially, in a way that makes other safety mechanisms more effective. for example, to protect against prompt injection in a news topic classification system, it makes sense to limit the amount of text a user can input in the summary field. any safety measure creates a tradeoff between restricting usage and guaranteeing safety, which in this case is found in the maximum allowed input length: set the threshold too high and prompt injection attacks will be more likely to succeed; set the threshold too low and legitimate inputs will be blocked. using a custom model, which is less susceptible to prompt injection out of the box, makes the tradeoff easier and allows a developer to choose a higher threshold while guaranteeing the same level of safety. appendix: no data? no problem! jurassic-1 custom models offer excellent accuracy even when trained on a surprisingly small dataset. nevertheless, sometimes even a small annotated dataset is hard to come by. wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be nice to enjoy the benefits of custom models without collecting any labeled data? as we will now demonstrate in our topic classification case study, this is possible. first, we note two simple observations: a prompt engineering solution with 1-4 examples per class achieves reasonable accuracy. the model assigns a probability to the label it generates, which indicates its â\\x80\\x9cconfidenceâ\\x80\\x9d in the label. high-confidence labels are more likely to be correct predictions. relying on these two observations, we propose the following simple approach: collect many unlabeled input examples for topic classification. use a prompt engineering-based solution to automatically label them with j1-jumbo. filter the auto-labeled examples by confidence, resulting in a dataset of examples where the model assigns >85% probability to the labels it predicted. make sure the different classes are equally represented in the dataset.â train a custom model on the high-confidence auto-labeled dataset. the table below shows the test set accuracy of custom models trained using this approach. we varied the number of labeled examples in the few-shot prompt, and used it to auto-label 160 examples for training. with just 4 labeled examples (1 per class), we beat j1-jumboâ\\x80\\x99s accuracy with an engineered prompt containing 8 labeled examples. using 16 labeled examples (4 per class) to auto-label a 160-example dataset, we not only beat j1-jumbo but also match the performance of a custom model trained on 160 manually labeled examples (88.5%). ag news test set accuracy for custom jurassic-1 models trained on 160 auto-labeled examples, while varying the number of manually labeled examples in the few-shot prompt used for auto-labeling. accuracy of j1-jumbo with a few-shot prompt utilizing the same amount of labeled data is shown for comparison. about the author enjoyed this?

rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

       "  'text': \"discover use cases for ai21 studio and jurassic-1 tutorial discover use cases for ai21 studio and jurassic-1 learn how to use jurassic-1 to perform summarization, idea generation, classification and many other language tasks in this blog post we showcase different ways of using ai21 studio and jurassic-1 to perform different language tasks. we hope these will help you kickstart your applications, and even inspire you to come up with ideas for new use cases. for convenience, the examples are grouped into categories, though this grouping doesnâ\\x80\\x99t follow very strict rules. make sure to check out the last group of fun examples for some laughs! all of the examples below use prompts we crafted manually, and they are available in ai21 studio as presets, so you can try them yourself, tinker with them and use them as a basis for your own prompts. prompt engineering, the process of composing a prompt to perform a specific task, is a fast, easy, and flexible way to build a demo or prototype. in fact, the prompts weâ\\x80\\x99re sharing here are the product of one day's work, at most. to take your application beyond proof-of-concept, we recommend you train a custom model. custom models in ai21 studio can be trained on very small datasets with as few as 50-100 examples. they offer better precision and latency and can be more economically scaled-up to serve production traffic. read our blog post to learn more about bootstrapping your own custom model. summarizing or simplifying text jurassic-1 is great at applying different transformations to existing text - consuming some text and then generating a piece of text that relates to it. one common transformation is summarization. summarization has many business use-cases, such as extracting the gist of online restaurant reviews: try it live in ai21 studio note that the model successfully follows the style of the example provided in the prompt, and outputs a sequence of short 2-3 word phrases summarizing the review. in a practical setting, we can imagine this method being used to squeeze reviews for display on small mobile devices. another useful transformation is simplifying text to make it more readable and accessible. a useful application could be rephrasing a sentence to avoid business jargon: try it live in ai21 studio or more explicitly, using jurassic-1 to explain the meaning of a word in context: try it live in ai21â\\xa0studio ideation and copywriting jurassic-1 can be used to augment human creativity in content creation, marketing, ecommerce and even creative writing. by priming our model with titles for blog posts about ai and tourism, we can generate plausible ideas for new blog posts about another topic of our choosing: try it live in ai21 studio humor and sarcasm are nuanced and notoriously hard for ai models to produce. nevertheless, it turns out you can feed article topics into the model and get it to generate funny headlines: try it live in ai21 studio another useful application is writing one-sentence product descriptions for marketing and ecommerce. in the following example, jurassic-1 generates a short description based on a product name and a list of features: try it live in ai21 studio generating code jurassic-1 models can process not only english text but also code in a variety of programming languages. we can use this to translate plain english descriptions into correct python one-liners: try it live in ai21 studio or even translate entire functions from one programming language to another: try it live in ai21 studio working with tables text often comes in a structured format, like a table. below are two examples that show how jurassic-1 can both extract information from a table and generate a properly formatted table from natural language: try it live in ai21 studio try it live in ai21 studio these two examples highlight the flexibility of jurassic-1â\\x80\\x99s universal â\\x80\\x9ctext-in, text-outâ\\x80\\x9d interface. the model properly handles various forms of text data out of the box, freeing developers to focus on core functionality instead of worrying about format conversions. classification most use-cases above were generative in nature, meaning they involve generating a phrase, sentence, line of code etc. another important subset of language tasks are text classification tasks, where the goal is to label a piece of text. for instance, consider topic classification. the following example demonstrates classifying news articles based on their title and their summary: try it live in ai21 studio note there are four categories - â\\x80\\x9cworldâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9csportsâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cbusinessâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cscience and technologyâ\\x80\\x9d - and we specify them explicitly in the prompt. the model then outputs these as the classification labels. we can use the same idea to perform binary classification. in this example the model determines whether a certain attribute indicates a high or low level of openness (one of the big five personality traits in psychology): try it live in ai21 studio this time, the two possible labels (â\\x80\\x9chighâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9clowâ\\x80\\x9d) arenâ\\x80\\x99t spelled out in the prompt, and the model picks them up from the examples. world knowledge because it was trained on a massive amount of text, jurassic-1 acquired knowledge about different topics. by composing a suitable prompt, we can retrieve facts encoded in the model in natural language form. itâ\\x80\\x99s often a good idea to build a q&a or â\\x80\\x9cinterviewâ\\x80\\x9d style prompt for this, like the one we use in the following example to answer sports trivia questions: try it live in ai21 studio a different kind of knowledge is common sense knowledge. in this example we probe the modelâ\\x80\\x99s ability to predict outcomes of different actions according to common sense: try it live in ai21 studio itâ\\x80\\x99s important to keep in mind that the coverage and accuracy of knowledge encoded in jurassic-1 may vary depending on factors such as time, topic and geography, and may also reflect bias found in the human-written texts the model was trained on. in particular, donâ\\x80\\x99t expect the model to possess highly domain-specific knowledge. furthermore, note that the model doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have any knowledge of current events, since it was trained on texts dated up to year 2020. other fun examples finally, weâ\\x80\\x99d like to share a few fun examples, built by members of our team on a one-day internal hackathon. these projects were primarily designed to make you laugh, but we hope they also help you imagine the opportunities that ai21 studio unlocks for media, content creation, human-computer interaction and many other industries. jurassic-1 write rap lyrics the team used jurassic-1 to generate lyrics for rap songs about historical figures. the inspiration is, of course, the musical hamilton. they primed the model with lyrics about alexander hamilton, george washington (both from â\\x80\\x9chamiltonâ\\x80\\x9d) and eva perã³n (from â\\x80\\x9cevitaâ\\x80\\x9d). then they had the model generate new lyrics about barack obama. note that they didnâ\\x80\\x99t explicitly provide the model with any of the biographical information about obama, so all the knowledge (harvard law, michelle, chicago etc.) is encoded within the model itself. once they had the lyrics, they packaged them nicely in a video using an off-the-shelf deep fake engine that supports rap, added a beat, et viola. â\\x80\\x8d jurades:â\\xa0aiâ\\xa0charades powered by jurassic-1 in this game, players take turns trying to communicate the identity of random famous characters, without stating their names, following the standard rules of charades. unlike a normal game of charades, the one responsible for guessing the the characters' identities is not a human, but a language model... jurassic-1! the model is fed with a few-shot prompt that taps into its world knowledge and text comprehension capabilities. jurassic-1 is surprsingly good at understanding non-coherent, associative descriptions that humans make under pressure. the prompt is set up to allow the model to self-correct based on failed guesses and follow up hints. â\\x80\\x8d jurassichess continuing our games theme, jurassichess uses jurassic-1 to give you verbal feedback on your chess moves, by integrating it with stockfish , an open-source chess ai. when you play against stockfish, it provides a score that represents the strength of your position as well as the aiâ\\x80\\x99s suggestions for the best alternative move ( in chess notation ). we feed this information into jurassic-1 and use specific prompts to generate relevant positive, negative or neutral feedback, resulting in a responsive ai chess tutor experience. and if you donâ\\x80\\x99t mind a little trash-talking, a different set of prompts gives your ai opponent a way to taunt you. about the author enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21 labs. thank you! your submission has been received! oops! something went

178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get?

ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks?

jurassic-1 models remain available until june 21st, 2023, after which they will be deprecated in favor of jurassic-2. what is the difference between training and usage rates for fine-tuned models? custom models cost the same to use as pre-trained foundation models. however, training a custom model requires a one-time fee. the cost is dependent on the selected model, and is calculated by the size of the dataset, measured in megabytes, multiplied by training duration, measured in epochs (each epoch is one complete run of the entire training dataset). what is an epoch, and how many epochs are required to train a custom model? when training a custom model, an epoch is defined as one pass of the entire training dataset. typically, models are trained for 5-20 epochs, though finding the optimum number of epochs may require experimentation. how can i track my usage and spending? to track usage, log in and navigate to 'account,' then click 'model usage'. this page shows a detailed view of your organization's usage for the current billing period. to see your future expected payment and previously paid invoices, navigate to 'account', and then click 'billing & plans'. when does the billing cycle begin? usage is billed monthly, starting on the date you upgraded to a paid plan. each month, the billing cycle is the same. on the day you upgrade, your usage for the month will be billed, and then the next month's billing cycle will start on the same date. this will continue on a monthly basis until you switch plans or cancel your subscription. who is eligible for the volume discount? volume discounts are available to customers with high monthly usage, regardless of whether they are developers, startups, enterprises, or research teams. this type of discount offers a reduced rate for increased usage, when subscribing to a custom plan. our sales team will be happy to tailor an offer to meet your requirements and volume of business. why am i no longer seeing the jurassic-2 large, grande and jumbo models? the jurassic-2 family of models has been renamed to make it easier for you to choose the model thatâ\\x80\\x99s right for you. the current lineup of models are: jurassic-2 ultra (formerly jurassic-2 jumbo instruct) jurassic-2 mid (formerly jurassic-2 grande instruct) jurassic-2 light (formerly jurassic-2 large with added instruct capabilities) all three foundation models follow natural-language instructions and allow for both zero-shot and few-shot prompting. for more information, please read here . api pricing docs terms of use privacy policy log in contact us featured jurassic-1 jurassic-x ai co-writing publications blog press\",\n",

       "  'text': \"pmi-masking publications pmi-masking we present a masking strategy that makes bidirectional masked-lm training more educating. in a nutshell in recent work described by an iclr 2021 spotlight paper , we show how to replace bertâ\\x80\\x99s random input masking strategy during pretraining with pmi-masking, which jointly masks neighboring tokens if they exhibit high correlation over the pretraining corpus. by preventing the model from focusing on shallow local signals, pmi-masking achieves better representations at a fraction of the training budget. despite altering only the input masking strategy, pmi-masking achieves the same bert pretraining quality in one sixth the time and achieves significantly better pretraining within the same training budget. â\\x80\\x8d masking: bertâ\\x80\\x99s added degree of freedom before bert, neural language models (lms) tended to be autoregressive, learning to predict each input token given preceding text. the masked language model (mlm) training objective of bert, for which the model learns to predict a masked subset of the input tokens, creates an inherently bidirectional representation of text. but this bidirectionality comes with an added degree of freedom relative to classical autoregressive lms: choosing which tokens to mask and which to show. our paper highlights that not all bidirectional dependencies are equal: we show that the strategy for choosing which tokens to mask and which to show can profoundly impact an mlmâ\\x80\\x99s performance. specifically, we show that the standard practice of random uniform masking often allows an mlm to minimize its training objective by latching onto shallow local signals, leading to pretraining inefficiency and suboptimal downstream performance. by limiting the modelâ\\x80\\x99s ability to rely on such shortcuts, we obtain the same pretraining performance more quickly and better performance within a fixed training budget. â\\x80\\x8d pmi-masking speed-up and improvement relatively to existing approaches on race. a motivating example to see the potential harm of local signals, we offer a simple, motivating example of neighboring tokens that are highly correlated with each other: part-of-word tokens that make up the same word. recall that bert represents text as a sequence of tokens, where each token is either a word or a part-of-word; e.g., â\\x80\\x9cchairâ\\x80\\x9d might constitute a single token while rarer words like â\\x80\\x9ceigenvalueâ\\x80\\x9d do not make it into bertâ\\x80\\x99s vocabulary and are broken up into several part-of-word tokens (â\\x80\\x9ce-igen-val-ueâ\\x80\\x9d). â\\x80\\x8d when using bertâ\\x80\\x99s regular vocabulary size of 30k tokens, the vast majority of encountered words are represented by single tokens (words are represented via ~1.1 tokens on average). however, when we artificially decrease the vocabulary size to 10k and then to 2k tokens, along the x axis of the following plot, part-of-word tokens become much more common (up to ~2 tokens-per-word on average). â\\x80\\x8d the blue curve in the above figure shows that when applying bertâ\\x80\\x99s strategy of choosing 15% of the tokens for masking uniformly at random, the model's performance is severely degraded as part-of-word tokens become prevalent. thus, by controlling the number of highly correlated tokens, we demonstrate that strong dependencies between neighboring input tokens can harm the modelâ\\x80\\x99s ability to learn from broader context. in the presence of such dependencies, the mlmâ\\x80\\x99s objective can often be minimized simply by considering immediate neighbors of the masked token (consider the easy task â\\x80\\x9ce-igen-[mask]-ueâ\\x80\\x9d). the red curve in the above figure shows that the degradation is substantially attenuated when local cues are occluded. this is done by applying whole word masking, a popular masking strategy which jointly occludes all part-of-word tokens comprising a word. our pmi-masking strategy, presented below, extends this solution to a much more prevalent class of highly correlated tokens: correlated word n-grams. â correlated word n-grams the above example of part-of-word tokens illustrated a flaw in bertâ\\x80\\x99s vanilla random masking approach, and the same issue occurs for correlated word n-grams, a class of correlated tokens that is harder to identify but affects any word level vocabulary. examples include phrases and multi-word expressions such as â\\x80\\x9ceditor in chiefâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cat onceâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9ccarbon footprintâ\\x80\\x9d, and so on. more broadly, many words provide a hint regarding the identity of their neighbors, and such shallow cues can be used by the model to minimize its objective while putting less emphasis on broader context. previous work has proposed masking strategies that can mitigate the effect of such local cues. notably, sun et al. (2019) proposed knowledge masking, which jointly masks tokens comprising entities and phrases, as identified by external parsers. the restriction to specific types of correlated n-grams, along with the reliance on imperfect tools for their identification, has limited the gains of this approach. with a similar motivation in mind, spanbert of joshi et al. (2020) introduced random-span masking, which masks word spans of lengths sampled from a geometric distribution at random positions in the text. random-span masking was shown to consistently outperform knowledge masking, however, with high probability the selected spans break up correlated n-grams, such that the prediction task can often be performed by relying on local cues. we offer a principled approach to masking spans that consistently provide high signal, unifying the intuitions behind the above approaches while also outperforming them. in order to identify highly correlated word n-grams, we rely on the measure of pointwise mutual information (pmi), which quantifies how surprising a bigram w1w2 is, given the unigram probabilities of w1 and w2 in the corpus. formally, given two tokens w1 and w2, the pmi of the bigram w1w2 is: â\\x80\\x8d where the probability of an n-gram p(w1... wn) is computed by the number of its occurrences in the corpus divided by the number of all n-grams in the corpus. pmi is a good indicator of correlation between words comprising a bigram, but extending it to measure correlation between words comprising longer n-grams is nontrivial. we propose the following extension of pmi to longer n-grams, and show that it provides a better signal than existing alternatives: where seg(w1... wn) is the set of all contiguous segmentations of the n-gram w1... wn (excluding the identity segmentation), and where any segmentation ï\\x83 â\\x88\\x88 seg(w1... wn) is composed of sub-spans that together give w1... wn. intuitively, this measure discards the contribution of high pmi subsegments of the considered n-gram; the minimum in the equation above implies that an n-gram's score is given by its weakest link, i.e., by the segmentation that comes closest to separability. this way, trigrams such as â\\x80\\x9ckuala lumpur isâ\\x80\\x9d are deranked, since despite the bigram â\\x80\\x9ckuala lumpurâ\\x80\\x9d having high pmi it is not highly correlated with the word â\\x80\\x9cisâ\\x80\\x9d, whereas â\\x80\\x9ceditor in chiefâ\\x80\\x9d, which cannot be broken to uncorrelated subsegments, is promoted for joint masking. experiments by jointly masking n-grams with high pmin scores, we speed up and improve bertâ\\x80\\x99s pretraining. when training models with either bertâ\\x80\\x99s vanilla random-token masking, spanbertâ\\x80\\x99s random-span masking or pmi-masking, in bertâ\\x80\\x99s original training setup (see details in paper), we get the following 1 to 2 point advantage in prominent benchmarks: when comparing to prominent released models of the same size (see table at the top of this post), we see that: pmi-masking outperforms a parallel approach of integrating word n-grams as tokens (pmi-masking vs. ambert). pmi-masking retains its advantage over random-span masking when training continues for 2.4 times longer than bertâ\\x80\\x99s original training (pmi-masking vs. spanbert). pmi-masking reaches the performance attained by vanilla random-token masking after â\\x85\\x99 of the training time (pmi-masking vs. roberta). 1 â\\xa0sun et al.

referred to as its sense . word-sense predictions made by sensebert on a raw input text. the word \"bass\" maps to its different supersenses according to context. sensebert - pre-training on word senses we propose a method to employ self-supervision directly at the word sense level. our model, named sensebert , is pre-trained to predict not only the masked words (as in bert) but also their wordnet supersenses. bertâ\\x80\\x99s current word-form level objective leads to what is commonly referred to as a language model: the model predicts words for the given masked position in a sentence. our added task allows sensebert to gather word-sense level statistics and thereby we effectively train a semantic-level language model that predicts the missing wordâ\\x80\\x99s meaning jointly with the standard word-form level prediction. self-supervision allows neural language models to learn from massive amounts of unannotated text. in order to enjoy this advantage at the lexical-semantic level, we make use of wordnet - an expert-constructed ontology that provides an inventory of word senses. we focus on a coarse-grained variant of word senses, referred to as supersenses, divided into 45 types that semantically categorize the entire language. â\\x80\\x8b labeling of words with a single supersense, for example the word â\\x80\\x98swordâ\\x80\\x99 which has only the supersense â\\x80\\x98artifactâ\\x80\\x99, is straightforward: we train the network to predict this supersense given the masked wordâ\\x80\\x99s context. as for words with multiple supersenses (like the word â\\x80\\x98bassâ\\x80\\x99 we discussed earlier), we train the model to predict any of these senses, leading to a simple yet effective labeling scheme. â\\x80\\x8b other than our additional pre-training task and the architecture changes that support it, we followed the architecture and training methods published in the bert paper. specifically, we trained models in two sizes, similar to bert model sizes - sensebertbase and sensebertlarge. our results below show significantly enhanced word meaning understanding abilities of sensebert, achieved without human annotation. word-sense predictions made by sensebert on the masked word in the sentence. results â\\x80\\x8bâ\\x80\\x8b in order to test our modelâ\\x80\\x99s lexical semantic abilities, we compared it with bert on two tasks: â\\x80\\x8b 1. â\\xa0semeval word superense disambiguation we constructed a supersense variant of the semeval-based wsd task, where the goal is to predict a wordâ\\x80\\x99s supersense given context. we trained and tested in two different schemes: a â\\x80\\x9cfrozenâ\\x80\\x9d model with a linear classifier on top (to explore the sense information captured in the modelâ\\x80\\x99s pre-trained embeddings). a â\\x80\\x9cfine-tunedâ\\x80\\x9d model, where the network weights have been modified during training. sensebertbase outscores both bertbase and bertlarge models by a large margin in both cases, and sensebertlarge yields even higher results. â â\\x80\\x8b 2. â\\xa0word in context (wic) â\\x80\\x8b the word in context (wic) task, from the superglue benchmark, is the task of predicting whether a word has the same meaning in two given sentences. this task heavily depends on word-supersense awareness. sensebertbase surpasses bertlarge, and a single sensebertlarge model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task with a score of 72.14. â â\\x80\\x8d about the author ori ram, yoav levine, itay dalmedigos, dor muhlgay, amnon shashua, kevin leyton-brown, yoav shoham lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. suspendisse varius enim in eros elementum tristique. duis cursus, mi quis viverra ornare, eros dolor interdum nulla, ut commodo diam libero vitae erat. aenean faucibus nibh et justo cursus id rutrum lorem imperdiet. nunc ut sem vitae risus tristique posuere. enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21 labs. thank you! your submission has been received! oops! something went wrong while submitting the form.',\n",

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get?

ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?

       "  'text': \"discover use cases for ai21 studio and jurassic-1 tutorial discover use cases for ai21 studio and jurassic-1 learn how to use jurassic-1 to perform summarization, idea generation, classification and many other language tasks in this blog post we showcase different ways of using ai21 studio and jurassic-1 to perform different language tasks. we hope these will help you kickstart your applications, and even inspire you to come up with ideas for new use cases. for convenience, the examples are grouped into categories, though this grouping doesnâ\\x80\\x99t follow very strict rules. make sure to check out the last group of fun examples for some laughs! all of the examples below use prompts we crafted manually, and they are available in ai21 studio as presets, so you can try them yourself, tinker with them and use them as a basis for your own prompts. prompt engineering, the process of composing a prompt to perform a specific task, is a fast, easy, and flexible way to build a demo or prototype. in fact, the prompts weâ\\x80\\x99re sharing here are the product of one day's work, at most. to take your application beyond proof-of-concept, we recommend you train a custom model. custom models in ai21 studio can be trained on very small datasets with as few as 50-100 examples. they offer better precision and latency and can be more economically scaled-up to serve production traffic. read our blog post to learn more about bootstrapping your own custom model. summarizing or simplifying text jurassic-1 is great at applying different transformations to existing text - consuming some text and then generating a piece of text that relates to it. one common transformation is summarization. summarization has many business use-cases, such as extracting the gist of online restaurant reviews: try it live in ai21 studio note that the model successfully follows the style of the example provided in the prompt, and outputs a sequence of short 2-3 word phrases summarizing the review. in a practical setting, we can imagine this method being used to squeeze reviews for display on small mobile devices. another useful transformation is simplifying text to make it more readable and accessible. a useful application could be rephrasing a sentence to avoid business jargon: try it live in ai21 studio or more explicitly, using jurassic-1 to explain the meaning of a word in context: try it live in ai21â\\xa0studio ideation and copywriting jurassic-1 can be used to augment human creativity in content creation, marketing, ecommerce and even creative writing. by priming our model with titles for blog posts about ai and tourism, we can generate plausible ideas for new blog posts about another topic of our choosing: try it live in ai21 studio humor and sarcasm are nuanced and notoriously hard for ai models to produce. nevertheless, it turns out you can feed article topics into the model and get it to generate funny headlines: try it live in ai21 studio another useful application is writing one-sentence product descriptions for marketing and ecommerce. in the following example, jurassic-1 generates a short description based on a product name and a list of features: try it live in ai21 studio generating code jurassic-1 models can process not only english text but also code in a variety of programming languages. we can use this to translate plain english descriptions into correct python one-liners: try it live in ai21 studio or even translate entire functions from one programming language to another: try it live in ai21 studio working with tables text often comes in a structured format, like a table. below are two examples that show how jurassic-1 can both extract information from a table and generate a properly formatted table from natural language: try it live in ai21 studio try it live in ai21 studio these two examples highlight the flexibility of jurassic-1â\\x80\\x99s universal â\\x80\\x9ctext-in, text-outâ\\x80\\x9d interface. the model properly handles various forms of text data out of the box, freeing developers to focus on core functionality instead of worrying about format conversions. classification most use-cases above were generative in nature, meaning they involve generating a phrase, sentence, line of code etc. another important subset of language tasks are text classification tasks, where the goal is to label a piece of text. for instance, consider topic classification. the following example demonstrates classifying news articles based on their title and their summary: try it live in ai21 studio note there are four categories - â\\x80\\x9cworldâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9csportsâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cbusinessâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cscience and technologyâ\\x80\\x9d - and we specify them explicitly in the prompt. the model then outputs these as the classification labels. we can use the same idea to perform binary classification. in this example the model determines whether a certain attribute indicates a high or low level of openness (one of the big five personality traits in psychology): try it live in ai21 studio this time, the two possible labels (â\\x80\\x9chighâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9clowâ\\x80\\x9d) arenâ\\x80\\x99t spelled out in the prompt, and the model picks them up from the examples. world knowledge because it was trained on a massive amount of text, jurassic-1 acquired knowledge about different topics. by composing a suitable prompt, we can retrieve facts encoded in the model in natural language form. itâ\\x80\\x99s often a good idea to build a q&a or â\\x80\\x9cinterviewâ\\x80\\x9d style prompt for this, like the one we use in the following example to answer sports trivia questions: try it live in ai21 studio a different kind of knowledge is common sense knowledge. in this example we probe the modelâ\\x80\\x99s ability to predict outcomes of different actions according to common sense: try it live in ai21 studio itâ\\x80\\x99s important to keep in mind that the coverage and accuracy of knowledge encoded in jurassic-1 may vary depending on factors such as time, topic and geography, and may also reflect bias found in the human-written texts the model was trained on. in particular, donâ\\x80\\x99t expect the model to possess highly domain-specific knowledge. furthermore, note that the model doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have any knowledge of current events, since it was trained on texts dated up to year 2020. other fun examples finally, weâ\\x80\\x99d like to share a few fun examples, built by members of our team on a one-day internal hackathon. these projects were primarily designed to make you laugh, but we hope they also help you imagine the opportunities that ai21 studio unlocks for media, content creation, human-computer interaction and many other industries. jurassic-1 write rap lyrics the team used jurassic-1 to generate lyrics for rap songs about historical figures. the inspiration is, of course, the musical hamilton. they primed the model with lyrics about alexander hamilton, george washington (both from â\\x80\\x9chamiltonâ\\x80\\x9d) and eva perã³n (from â\\x80\\x9cevitaâ\\x80\\x9d). then they had the model generate new lyrics about barack obama. note that they didnâ\\x80\\x99t explicitly provide the model with any of the biographical information about obama, so all the knowledge (harvard law, michelle, chicago etc.) is encoded within the model itself. once they had the lyrics, they packaged them nicely in a video using an off-the-shelf deep fake engine that supports rap, added a beat, et viola. â\\x80\\x8d jurades:â\\xa0aiâ\\xa0charades powered by jurassic-1 in this game, players take turns trying to communicate the identity of random famous characters, without stating their names, following the standard rules of charades. unlike a normal game of charades, the one responsible for guessing the the characters' identities is not a human, but a language model... jurassic-1! the model is fed with a few-shot prompt that taps into its world knowledge and text comprehension capabilities. jurassic-1 is surprsingly good at understanding non-coherent, associative descriptions that humans make under pressure. the prompt is set up to allow the model to self-correct based on failed guesses and follow up hints. â\\x80\\x8d jurassichess continuing our games theme, jurassichess uses jurassic-1 to give you verbal feedback on your chess moves, by integrating it with stockfish , an open-source chess ai. when you play against stockfish, it provides a score that represents the strength of your position as well as the aiâ\\x80\\x99s suggestions for the best alternative move ( in chess notation ). we feed this information into jurassic-1 and use specific prompts to generate relevant positive, negative or neutral feedback, resulting in a responsive ai chess tutor experience. and if you donâ\\x80\\x99t mind a little trash-talking, a different set of prompts gives your ai opponent a way to taunt you. about the author enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21 labs. thank you! your submission has been received! oops! something went

released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the

training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example -

       "  'text': 'build a dashboard based on freeform sentiment analysis of hotel reviews tutorial build a dashboard based on freeform sentiment analysis of hotel reviews analyze large quantities of reviews in minutes using ai21 studio imagine that you have a platform for hotel reservations, similar to hotels.com . on your platform, hotel visitors can leave written reviews and an overall star rating for the hotel. these reviews allow hotel owners to gain a general understanding of guest satisfaction through their overall score, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s just one part of the story. the quality of the hotel experience is a combination of many factors, including the room quality, the facilities, and the staff. ideally, the owner would like to get a clear picture of their hotelâ\\x80\\x99s strengths and weaknesses so they can improve on the aspects that are lacking and highlight the aspects that visitors find positive. to extract these insights, some hotel owners sit down from time to time and read all of the reviews that were written about their hotel. this is a tedious task - one you, as a developer, would probably want to spare your users from. what if you could create a dashboard that highlights the areas guests mention positively or negatively in their reviews? as a result, your user - in this case, the hotel owner - can get a real-time snapshot of their strengths and weaknesses with just a glance at this dashboard. not so long ago, you would have needed to work pretty hard to create a solution like that (for example, using several classical methods ). but with large language models (llms), itâ\\x80\\x99s really easy. you can perform this analysis with high accuracy, even with no prior knowledge of natural language processing (nlp). if that sounds appealing to you, then read on. by the end of this post, you will be able to implement this feature in your platform or product. this post will walk you through the process of building an nlp-powered dashboard for a hotel, including: using an external api to gather real-world data. performing freeform combined topic extraction and sentiment analysis using jurassic-1, part of the ai21 studio suite of large language models. generating the output in a convenient format (json) so itâ\\x80\\x99s easier to process. if you are new to large language models, we recommend first reading this post . step 1: collect reviews using an external api you can find the hotels.com api on rapidapi . there are several endpoints to this api. we need the reviews endpoint, that returns the reviews for a given hotel, page-by-page. there are approximately 50 reviews per page. in order to retrieve all of the available reviews we will call the api while iterating through the pages. the following functions do just that: def get_hotel_reviews_page(hotel_id, page_number):\\n    params = {\\n        \"locale\": \"en_us\", \\n        \"hotel_id\": hotel_id, \\n        \"page_number\": str(page_number)\\n    }\\n    headers = {\\n        \"x-rapidapi-key\": rapid_api_key,\\n        \"x-rapidapi-host\": \"hotels-com-provider.p.rapidapi.com\"\\n    }\\n    response = requests.get(url=get_reviews_url, headers=headers, params=params)\\n     \\n    reviews = [\\n        review[\\'summary\\'] \\n        for page_reviews in response.json()[\\'groupreview\\']\\n        for review in page_reviews[\\'reviews\\']\\n    ]\\n    return reviews\\n\\n\\ndef get_hotel_reviews(hotel_id, num_pages):\\n    all_reviews = sum(\\n        [get_hotel_reviews_page(hotel_id, page_number) for page_number in range(1, num_pages + 1)],\\n        start=[]\\n    )\\n    return all_reviews â\\x80\\x8d note that running this function requires an api key for the reviews endpoint, which you can obtain from rapidapi. this is not your ai21 studio api key. there are some edge cases that this function doesnâ\\x80\\x99t cover, such as requesting a page number that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t exist, but weâ\\x80\\x99ll set them aside for the purposes of this blog post. throughout this process, we will use the empire hotel in new york as a running example. you can use an api endpoint to get the hotel id, or you can find it in the hotelâ\\x80\\x99s url on hotels.com: step 2: prepare the reviews data for the language model large language models are very powerful and can ingest text of all shapes and sizes, but as the old saying goes, â\\x80\\x9cgarbage in, garbage outâ\\x80\\x9d. if you feed the model a bad prompt, the results will be far from optimal. in this case, you should keep the following points in mind: reviews that are too short could be problematic since they often do not contain enough information to extract any meaningful insights. currently, our models are limited to the english language only. in order to remove reviews that are too short or not in english, you can apply some simple filters to all of the reviews: from langdetect import detect\\ndef filter_reviews(reviews):\\n    en_reviews = [review for review in reviews if len(review)>=20 and detect(review)==\"en\"]\\n            \\n    return en_reviews â\\x80\\x8d note: here, we have removed reviews that have no real content by applying a very basic filter. although this is not mandatory, we recommend that you pre-process your reviews by, for example, removing weird characters and extra spaces, etc. step 3: extract the categories and sentiments using ai21 studio this step is where you trulyâ\\xa0 harness the power of ai21 studioâ\\x80\\x99s large language models!â you want the model to extract the topics and sentiments of each free text review into a structured json format. you can do this by leveraging a main strength of language models: when provided with text in plain english, the language model can identify patterns and generate text that follows the same pattern. by feeding the model a prompt with a few examples (this is called a few-shot prompt ), it can identify the pattern and generate a reasonably good completion. obtaining these examples, however, requires you to manually go through several reviews, which we have done below. the resulting few-shot prompt is as follows (the reviews are as written by the platformâ\\x80\\x99s users, with no grammar or spelling corrections): review: great experience for two teenagers. we would book again. location good. extracted sentiment: {\"location\": \"positive\"} ## review: extremely old cabinets, phone was half broken and full of dust. bathroom door was broken, bathroom floor was dirty and yellow. bathroom tiles were falling off. asked to change my room and the next room was in the same conditions. the most out of date and least maintained hotel i ever been on. extracted sentiment: {\"cleaning\": \"negative\", \"hotel facilities\": \"negative\", \"room quality\": \"negative\"} ## review: roof topâ\\x80\\x99s view is gorgeous and the lounge area is comfortable. the staff is very courteous and the location is great. the hotel is outdated and the shower need to be clean better. the air condition runs all the time and cannot be control by the temperature control setting. extracted sentiment: {\"cleaning\": \"negative\", \"ac\": \"negative\", \"room quality\": \"negative\", \"service\": \"positive\", \"view\": \"positive\", \"hotel facilities\": \"positive\"} ## creating a good prompt is more than simply deciding on the pattern. the goal is to construct a prompt that triggers the model to generate the optimal completion (this is called prompt engineering ). to achieve this, you should keep the following in mind: variety: the examples in the prompt will determine the modelâ\\x80\\x99s responses for unseen data, so they must be diverse enough to reflect the real-world distribution. this applies to both the structure of the reviews (such as length) and the content (the topics discussed in every review, the sentiments, etc.). be sure to include reviews that are mixed in sentiment (like the third example provided above), as these are usually harder to analyze. amount: how â\\x80\\x9cfewâ\\x80\\x9d examples should our few-shot prompt include? when it comes to this relatively complex task, it is recommended that you provide at least eight different examples in the prompt (depending on the number of topics and the variety within them). the most effective way to determine this is through testing it out in the playground. try it yourself! â additionally, in this use-case, we recommend setting the temperature to 0, as high accuracy is required more than creativity. increasing the temperature will result in more creative results, while lowering the temperature will increase their accuracy. curious about temperature? see step 4 in this post for more detail on this. happy with the prompt and want to start analyzing reviews? you can copy the few-shot prompt from the playground: and use the following function to create the prompt for every review: def create_review_prompt(review):\\n    few_shot_examples = few_shot_examples\\n    prompt = few_shot_examples + review + \"\\\\nextracted sentiment:\\\\n\"\\n    return prompt â\\x80\\x8d for every review, create the prompt and then call jurassic-1 to perform the analysis (you can take the call from the playground, as illustrated above, or use the function from here ). step 4: create the dashboard once you have the list of topics and sentiments, you can create your dashboard. first, gather all of the topics together, assigning a count of \"positive\" or \"negative\" to each topic. since you already have the completion in json format, you can process it using standard packages. however, as the format may not be perfect, and you donâ\\x80\\x99t want any failures in your automated process, you can add a simple try-catch block. this means if a completion from the model isnâ\\x80\\x99t in perfect json format, you drop it. you can use the following function: def get_topk_categories_and_score(sentiments, k=7):\\n    parsed_sentiments = []\\n    for sentiment in sentiments:\\n      try:\\n         parsed_sentiments.append(ast.literal_eval(sentiment))\\n      except syntaxerror:\\n        pass\\n    \\n    df = pd.dataframe(parsed_sentiments)\\n\\n    # extract the k categories with the most reviews    \\n    keys = df.count().sort_values(ascending=false)[:k].index.tolist()\\n    \\n    category_names = [\\'negative\\', \\'positive\\']\\n    scores = {}\\n\\n    for key in keys:\\n        scores[key] = [(df[key] == category_names[0]).sum(), (df[key] == category_names[1]).sum()]\\n        \\n    return scores, category_names â\\x80\\x8d at this stage, all thatâ\\x80\\x99s left to do is create the figure. with minor changes to this matplotlib example, youâ\\x80\\x99ll have your dashboard: you can see that the hotel is deemed excellent in location and rather good in service and cleaning. however, it should invest more in the wifi and ac, and perhaps do some renovations or upgrades to the rooms and facilities. as a last step and some sanity check, youâ\\x80\\x99ll probably want to validate your results, but without manually reading every review. one way to do that is to compare them with those of other hotel platforms, such as booking.com. if you go to the booking.com page for this hotel , where visitors are asked to rate hotels across numerous categories, you will find the overall picture is very similar to your own analysis: summary by following the steps laid out in this post, you have built a very useful feature that can be implemented on hotel and accommodation platforms. thanks to large language models, analyzing pieces of text, such as reviews, has never been easier. a few simple tweaks, such as writing the examples in json format, can save a lot of time in post-processing, making the entire process faster and easier. you can find the full notebook in our dev-hub . are you interested in building your own feature? with a custom model, youâ\\x80\\x99llâ\\xa0 always get the highest quality results. you can find out more about that here . â\\x80\\x8d about the author

whitepaper paper: standing on the shoulders of giant language models try for yourself contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that\\'s it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it\\'s your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly. name * email * message * thank you!

not so long ago, the answer to this question was â\\x80\\x98no!â\\x80\\x99. today, thanks to large language models, practitioners with different levels of expertise can build applications that generate useful text for marketing, content writing and more.â hold on tight, because in this blog post weâ\\x80\\x99re going to go from an idea to a completely new text generation feature that you can ship immediately. ready to get started?â motivation suppose you\\'re building a job marketplace app or a personnel recruitment platform. you probably have a feature that lets candidates upload their cv to your system. those cvs aren\\'t always stellar. for example, many of them lack a profile section - a short paragraph that highlights the candidateâ\\x80\\x99s background, skills and ambitions. luckily, you can use ai21 studio to help your users by auto-generating a cv profile for them. this is just one example of short-form content generation, where language models are used to draft text up to a paragraph long (more examples are in the summary). in this post we\\'ll build a cv profile generator that you can integrate into your application or website in just a few minutes of work. step 1: define the problem understanding what kind of text you want to generate is essential. in this case we need to ask ourselves:â\\xa0 what makes a good cv profile that our users will appreciate? letâ\\x80\\x99s take a look at some examples and try to find ones we like. here is an article you can find online that shows various types of cv profiles. for example, letâ\\x80\\x99s look at a profile for a chemical engineer: i am a dedicated, hardworking and proactive chemical engineer with a strong background in design, plant operations, offshore operations, and process and safety improvements. i have solid work experience in designing, testing and analysing processes to increase the overall efficiency of operations. i am currently looking for an opportunity to utilise my technical skills in a challenging working environment and become a valuable asset to the organization that i work for. as you can see, itâ\\x80\\x99s a short paragraph that covers the candidates background, experience and the type of role they are looking for. browsing through more examples, it is clear that most cv profiles follow this pattern. letâ\\x80\\x99s make a note of a few examples (3-5 will do) that we like. our goal is to generate texts similar to these examples. now we are ready to log into the ai21 studio and start building. step 2: create your (initial) prompt language models take in some text as input and generate some likely continuation of that text. we call the input text the prompt and the generated text the completion . you can think of large language models as smart auto-completion algorithms: they are very good at latching on to hints and patterns expressed in plain english, and generating text that follows the same patterns.â for example, if we input a prompt that is likely to be followed by a cv profile, we can get the model to generate new and original cv profiles as completions. one simple way to do this is to spell out an instruction, just like you would when asking a person to produce some text: write a winning teaching cv profile: letâ\\x80\\x99s take this prompt and see what the model will generate. go to the ai21 studio, put this prompt in the input field and click â\\x80\\x9cgeneratedâ\\x80\\x9d. this is the completion the model generated: mr george mwangi is a teacher who has completed diploma, degree and masters degree in education. he has vast teaching experience of 7 years. his expertise is in the field of science, biology, chemistry and physics. he is a hardworking, dedicated candidate with vast experience of teaching various levels, including university students. what do we like about this completion? it matches the profession we provided (teacher).â it contains relevant education and experience. it uses some good adjectives. what do we not like about this completion? this paragraph is written in third person (â\\x80\\x9cmr mwangi isâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d), whereas our good cv profile examples are always written in the first person (â\\x80\\x9ci amâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9d). the details the model generated are completely made up - they may or may not reflect our candidates\\' true skills. how can we make the model produce the output we want? you can try to phrase the instruction differently. be descriptive and clear, and try a few different ones, like: following is an exceptional cv profile for a teacher: or here is an enthusiastic teacherâ\\x80\\x99s cv profile: that said, you shouldn\\'t spend too much time on choosing the perfect adjectives.â the most powerful tool you have at your disposal is providing examples that demonstrate what you expect from the model. this is the most effective way to guide the generations according to your intentions, and if you have time to do only one thing - this is it. in this case, we already collected some relevant examples in step 1. all thatâ\\x80\\x99s left is to create the prompt from instruction-profile pairs. below you can find a prompt we made by stringing together a sequence of examples we liked. the bold text is the completion our model generated. write a winning sales/retail cv profile: i am a mature, positive and hardworking individual, who always strives to achieve the highest standard possible, at any given task. in my previous role as a sales representative, i demonstrated the ability to work under intense pressure, sell products and services to customers from all backgrounds, handle customer complaints and solve problematic situations as and when they arose. i was promoted twice for exceeding my sales targets. ## write a winning teaching cv profile: i am a loyal, talented and caring teacher who loves making a difference in the lives of young children. i am open-minded, patient and supportive towards other people, especially towards children or those who suffer from disabilities. in my previous role as a primary school teacher, i have taught and nurtured more than 100 pupils from all backgrounds, successfully preparing them for the next stages of their young lives. ## write a winning media cv profile: i am a professional, ambitious and highly skilled camera operator able to use a wide range of technical equipment, including professional cinematography camcorders. i have extensive experience working on a number of television and theatre projects, demonstrating an ability to follow artistic direction and the physical capability required on a professional production set. i am comfortable filming on-location and outside the studio with some previous work experience in live broadcasting. ## write a winning software engineer cv profile: i am a highly talented software engineer with extensive experience of developing complex software systems. i have excellent analytical and problem-solving skills, which allow me to quickly identify and resolve problems. i am self-motivated, able to work on my own initiative and as part of a team. i have excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, and i am able to communicate effectively with people from a wide range of backgrounds. ## did we solve all the problems? well, the profile is written in first person, just like we wanted. unfortunately, it still contains made up details. we solve this in the following section. there are a couple of important things to note here: the instruction we chose was â\\x80\\x9cwrite a winning â\\x80¦ cv profile:â\\x80\\x9d. itâ\\x80\\x99s good to be consistent and use the exact same phrasing throughout the examples in the prompt. each cv profile ends with a pair of hashes, which establishes a pattern for the model to follow. as a result, when the model produces a new cv profile in the completion, it generates â\\x80\\x98##â\\x80\\x99 after it. we can use this signal to detect that the entire profile has been written and terminate the generation using the stop sequence parameter . want to see the generation or check another profile? try it yourself in our playground . step 3: add personalization to your prompt the prompt we have at this point produces well-formatted, impressive-sounding cv profiles for specific roles. you can try it in the playground and see that itâ\\x80\\x99s pretty reliable. each time we generate a new text, we get a random profile for a candidate for the desired role.â although the profiles fit the role, they may be inconsistent with the candidates\\' actual skills, experience and ambitions. you probably want to provide your users a way to guide the generated profile to stick to the facts that are true for them. one way to do it is to inject specific features that you want to be reflected in the profile into the instruction. we took the prompt from the previous section and tweaked it to include â\\x80\\x9cfeaturesâ\\x80\\x9d. we extracted them manually from the examples we gathered earlier. this is the completion generated by the model: write a winning business management cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. logical mind 2. problem solver 3. 2 years of experience in management 4. eager to learn profile: i have a clear, logical mind with a practical approach to problem-solving and a drive to see things through to completion. i have more than 2 years of experience in managing and leading teams across multiple sectors. i am eager to learn, i enjoy overcoming challenges, and i have a genuine interest in business management and making organisations successful. ## write a winning it cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. experience it professional 2. record designing websites, networking and managing databases 3. excellent interpersonal skills 4. looking for a challenge profile: i am a highly competent it professional with a proven track record in designing websites, networking and managing databases. i have strong technical skills as well as excellent interpersonal skills, enabling me to interact with a wide range of clients. i am eager to be challenged in order to grow and further improve my it skills. my greatest passion is in life is using my technical know-how to benefit other people and organisations. ## write a winning sales executive cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. energetic and ambitious 2. 6 years of selling experience 3. love working in a team 4. independent 5. mba from stanford profile: i am an energetic and ambitious sales executive with 6 years of selling experience. i am a team player, but i am also able to work on my own initiative. i am an mba from stanford, and i am looking for a challenging position where i can use my sales skills to benefit an organisation. ## you can see that now we can direct the model to include specific skills and experience! want to see how your features turn into a profile? try here . when working with prompts like these, it is critical to maintain a strong correlation between the features and the generation. if an example\\'s output mentions facts that totally contradict the input or are completely original and unrelated, the model will follow suit and have a tendency to make up things. we call this phenomenon â\\x80\\x9challucinationsâ\\x80\\x9d. on the other hand, if you omit certain features from an example\\'s output, the model will imitate this and occasionally drop some of the provided features. to understand that, letâ\\x80\\x99s take a look at the following bad example (do not try this at home!): write a winning business manager cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. creative person 2. experience in management 3. have an mba from stanford profile: i have a clear, logical mind with a practical approach to problem-solving and a drive to see things through to completion. i have more than 2 years of experience in managing and leading teams across multiple sectors. i am eager to learn, i enjoy overcoming challenges, and i have a genuine interest in business management and making organisations successful. ## write a winning it manager cv profile incorporating the following features: 1. experience it professional 2. record designing websites, networking and managing databases 3. excellent interpersonal skills 4. looking for a challenge profile: having 3 years experience in all aspects of it, including web design, networking, databases and technical support. i am looking for a new challenge. i thrive in challenging environments and i am committed to high standards in all aspects of my work. ## a single example (business manager) was fed into the model here, but there is some mismatch between some skills and the profile. the table below shows both phenomena in this example: what was wrong with the prompt, and how it affected the completion. prompt (business manager) completion (it manager) hallucination 2 years of experience 3 years of experience omission creativity, mba interpersonal skills â\\x80\\x8d step 4: explore the parameters another way to affect the completion is to adjust some of the generation parameters. there are quite a few parameters and you can learn about them here . for now, let\\'s focus on one of the most significant parameters: temperature.â the temperature controls creativity. increasing the temperature tends to result in more varied and creative completions, whereas decreasing it produces more stable and repetitive completions. with temperature set to zero, the model will always generate the most probable completion for a given prompt (which will be the same completion every time). below are examples of three different generations using the same prompt from the previous step:â temperature completion 0 i am an energetic and ambitious sales executive with 6 years of selling experience. i am a team player, but i am also able to work on my own initiative. i am an mba from stanford, and i am looking for a challenging position where i can use my sales skills to benefit an organisation. 0.7 i am ambitious, energetic and hard-working. over the last 6 years, i have gained valuable experience in selling products and services to businesses and consumers. i possess strong communication and presentation skills and i am a team player. i am good at building relationships with clients and i am known for my integrity and honesty. i am currently studying for an mba from stanford. i am confident that i can build a successful career in sales. 1 i am an extremely ambitious and energetic individual with 6 years of selling experience. i have a strong business administration degree, along with an mba from stanford, which has increased my market knowledge. i am a team player who thrives in challenging environments and relishes the opportunity to work autonomously. want to see more results? try it yourself in the playground! step 5: integrate with your code after you\\'ve finished building your prompt and you are happy with the results you see in the playground, you\\'d want to integrate some code to call the ai21 studio api in your product. you can click the api button and copy the necessary code snippet. the request includes your api key (which is linked to your account), certain parameters, and more importantly - the prompt. in production the prompt will need to end with a different input every time we generate a completion, corresponding to the role and the candidate features. we\\'ll need to write a bit of code that injects this into our prompt. here\\'s how you would do it in python: def create_prompt(role, highlights):\\n    \"\"\"\\n        arguments:\\n        - role         : what is the profession of the candidate\\n        - highlights   : what are the skills and ambitions of the candidate\\n\\n        returns:\\n        - prompt       : a full prompt, including few shot examples\\n    \"\"\"\\n    \\n    few_shot_prompt = #paste here the few shot prompt, ends with the stop sequence#\\n    current_input = f\"write a winning {role} incorporating the following features:\\\\n\"\\n    skills_str = \"\"\\n    for i in range(len(highlights)):\\n        skills_str += f\"{i + 1:d}. {highlights[i]}\\\\n\"\\n    skills_str += \"\\\\nprofile:\"\\n\\n    return few_shot_prompt + current_input + skills_str check out this notebook for more details. summary in this post, we have explored the process of going from an idea to an implementation of a short-form text generation feature with ai21 studio. other examples of short-form text that you can generate with ai21 studio are tweets , online ads , product descriptions and more. creating a good prompt is a process that involves some trial and error, but it doesn\\'t require a phd in ai. so don\\'t give up if your first attempt fails to produce good results. look for good examples and keep iterating! â\\x80\\x8d about the author yuval belfer enjoyed this?

if the system detects that a guest is angry, we could immediately notify the manager. if a guest is satisfied, weâ\\x80\\x99d ask them to leave a review, etc.â\\x80\\x9dâ use case #2: automatic translation every hotel is filled with travelers from and to various countries. the importance of having a staff with multiple languages cannot be overstated. however, knowledge of every language is not always possible, which is why translation apps are useful. easyway offers high-quality 2-way translation capabilities in 100+ languages. â\\x80\\x9ca spanish guest will speak spanish and the staff will be speaking hebrew and the conversation will be understandable for each side,â\\x80\\x9d asaf explains. â\\x80\\x9cso each person can just use their native language, plus we use ai to respond to messages automatically.â\\x80\\x9d this feature was already in production before easyway reached out to ai21, but there was much room for improvement. â\\x80\\x9cone of the gaps we had to tackle was a varying level of grammar amongst our end users. the problem involved two aspects; the level of service that our clients provide their guests, and the efficiency of our translation feature. if a person writing on our platform didnâ\\x80\\x99t write properly, the live translation wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t work properly.â\\x80\\x9dâ by incorporating the same technology that is used in wordtune, ai21â\\x80\\x99s flagship ai writing assistant, this was made possible. the future for easyway what if you could not only automate away repetitive questions, but also begin to automatically set common responses to faqs? easyway is currently running a pilot to embed a chat widget on one of their partnersâ\\x80\\x99 websites, gearing up for a possible new offer. â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99re [piloting this feature] with a customer in europe that has a lot of visitors to their website - around 150k each month, and they don't have the staff to deal with it. so they just end up with thousands of emails asking basic questions that nobody responds to,â\\x80\\x9d asaf says. with easyway, hotels can automate and schedule messages based on events such as booking, arrival, and departure.â a typical post-booking conversation could be: â\\x80\\x9chey asaf, thank you for booking your stay with us. do you have any questions?â\\x80\\x9dâ asaf may type: â\\x80\\x9chow do i get to the hotel?â\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cwhat are the covid regulations?â\\x80\\x9d the chat platform is set up to respond automatically, helping hotels save time with quality ai. the result: automated, human-centered conversations that save time remember those 200 or more messages we mentioned hotels can receive each day? to reach success, easyway will look at how many emails each hotel actually needs to personally answer after using their application powered by ai21. asaf stated that a â\\x80\\x9c10, 20, 30% [reduction rate] would be amazing.â\\x80\\x9dâ overall, we are thrilled to have the opportunity to use our nlp technology to help alleviate the administrative burdens that hotels experience on a daily basis â\\x80\\x93 while still uplifting the 5-star experience guests want from their hotel of choice. about the author enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21 labs. thank you! your submission has been received! oops! something went wrong while submitting the form. mrkl whitepaper paper: standing on the shoulders of giant language models try for yourself contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly. name * email * message * thank you! your submission has been received! oops! something went wrong while submitting the form. related articles announcements ai21 labs on bedrock: now available for every amazon customer weâ\\x80\\x99re excited to share the expanded availability of our jurassic models on amazon's bedrock platform. announcements ai21 labs' latest llms now available in google cloud marketplace ai21 labs is excited to announce that our proprietary jurassic large language models (llms) and task-specific models are now available on google marketplace, giving customers seamless access to build and deploy generative ai-driven applications. ai21 labs announces series c funding round at $1.4 billion valuation weâ\\x80\\x99re thrilled to announce the completion of a successful series c funding round of $155 million at a valuation of $1.4 billion, marking a major milestone in our company's journey to bring reliable ai to the enterprise. announcements ai21 labs to integrate generative ai capabilities with bigquery today marks an exciting milestone as we announce our collaboration with google cloud, offering our state-of-the-art generative ai capabilities on top of bigquery.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'the use of generative ai in ecommerce seo blog posts the use of generative ai in ecommerce seo when it comes to optimizing websites for seo, ecommerce businesses face even greater challenges than regular companies.\\nthis guide offers a deep dive into common ecommerce seo challenges and how generative ai can help overcome them. when it comes to optimizing websites for seo, ecommerce businesses face even greater challenges than regular companies. these challenges include generating relevant and high-quality content at scale, optimizing traffic based on factors like seasonality and events, and generating thousands of pages that target different keywords. for executives and seo managers concerned about the overall budget and effectiveness of their seo strategy, generative ai proves to be an effective solution.â this guide offers a deep dive into common ecommerce seo challenges and how generative ai can help overcome them.â\\xa0â ecommerce seo challenges 1. producing relevant and high-quality content at scale creating quality content for an online store with a multitude of items can be challenging. it requires conducting research, writing, editing, and optimizing content, all of which takes a lot of time and energy, particularly considering the sheer number of items. moreover, as the number of products increases, maintaining consistency and uniqueness becomes more difficult, leading to potential issues, such as duplication. it takes a delicate balance of manpower, expertise, and budget to balance scale, with seo-optimized content for each product. 2. optimizing content equally crucial to content creation is the adoption of an ongoing review and optimization process of existing content. this is directed by a range of factors, including userâ\\x80\\x99s search patterns, seasonal shifts, and emerging trends. for instance, during christmas, buyers are more likely to search for keywords such as â\\x80\\x9cchristmas sweaterâ\\x80\\x9d rather than â\\x80\\x9cwinter sweater.â\\x80\\x9d therefore, when christmas approaches, ecommerce businesses need to tweak multiple listings to optimize them accordingly. regardless of how minor the changes are, implementing them across thousands of product listings is a challenging and resource-intensive task.â 3. dealing with googleâ\\x80\\x99s search generative experience (sge)â with the anticipated introduction of google\\'s search generative experience (sge), users will see new search results, featuring summary snapshots generated by google\\'s ai bot. this means that standard search results will be pushed even further down the search page, making it crucial to optimize title tags and other content.â to improve their chances of appearing in google\\'s shopping graph, ecommerce businesses will have to be aware of how the search engineâ\\x80\\x99s algorithm works, and create high-quality, accurate, and valuable product-led content accordingly. 4 ways to use generative ai in ecommerce seo with these challenges in mind, letâ\\x80\\x99s explore how generative ai can help. 1. generate various forms of content at scale ecommerce businesses can use generative ai to create different forms of content at scale. these include: product descriptions with generative ai, ecommerce businesses can automate the process of writing product descriptions at scale , helping them to rank higher in serps, which will become increasingly more challenging with the roll out of sge. the benefits of llm based product description generators, which can be tailored to each specific companyâ\\x80\\x99s needs, is that they can be trained to follow a specific format, length, and tone of voice, in order to keep all of the content consistent and in line with the brandâ\\x80\\x99s tone.â on-page seo elements generative ai can also help generate on-page seo elements at scale, including page titles, meta-descriptions, and alt-texts.â this way, ecommerce businesses can save countless hours and resources that theyâ\\x80\\x99d have otherwise had to spend doing it for each product listing individually.â faqs customers will inevitably have questions about products, delivery times, policies and more. generative ai can help produce relevant questions and answers at scale, enabling ecommerce stores to give as much information as possible to all of their users, and increase their chance of being ranked. product-led content product-led content such as blog posts, newsletters, and how-to pages can help ecommerce businesses give in-depth answers to user queries, and then direct them back to the relevant product listings.â for example, letâ\\x80\\x99s take a retail store that specializes in selling various advanced gadgets, including high-quality earphones. in this situation, the store can create a helpful \"how-to\" guide where it would explain how to fix earphones that aren\\'t working.â here too, using generative aiâ\\x80\\x99s text generation abilities, ecommerce businesses are able to produce valuable product-led content more easily and at scale.â generate content in multiple languages ai can also be used to generate content in multiple languages, whether it\\'s blog posts, user guides, product descriptions, or other types of content. pro-tip: ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99 jurassic-2 (j2) models can be integrated into your website or application to help with content generation.â\\xa0according to our internal evaluations from helm, the leading benchmark for language models, jurassic-2 ultra scores a win-rate of 86.8%, solidifying it as a leader in the llm space. furthermore, j2 models support a number of languages, including french, spanish, portuguese, german, dutch, and italian, as well as english. content optimizationâ generative ai can also serve as a significant component, not only in crafting first drafts of content such as product descriptions, blog posts, etc., but also in enhancing content optimization. when shifts occur in seasonality or user search patterns, businesses can harness the capabilities of text generation. by inputting appropriate changes which need to be made, an ai text generation tool can seamlessly produce updated content, while retaining the original structure.â 2. provide a great user experience websites that provide an excellent user experience are ranked higher by search engines.â with the help of generative ai, ecommerce businesses can implement a contextual answers solution to help answer any question customers may have.â with contextual answers, ai21 studio\\'s question answering solution, an ecommerce business can implement an automated response system on their website, which retrieves its answers from a specific library of documents, such as help center content. this response system is able to provide accurate and relevant answers based only on the content available in those libraries.â this can further help reduce customer support wait times and provide instant answers to customer queries, enhancing the overall user experience.â contextual answers can also be used internally, by the support team. if they are engaging in conversation with a user, and do not know the answer to a specific question, they can use the contextual answers solution to search for the response they need from within the companyâ\\x80\\x99s internal databases. this too can reduce wait times, and improve the customer satisfaction, further improving the users\\' experience on the website.â\\xa0â\\xa0â 3. create ai-powered toolsâ with the help of llms, ecommerce businesses can create ai-powered tools with the goal of generating traffic for them. a great example is an ai-powered birthday greeting generator for a gift shop. when a customer visits the online store, they can access this tool by clicking on a designated button. the tool will prompt users to input basic information like the recipientâ\\x80\\x99s name, relationship to the sender, age, and any specific preferences they have for the greeting (e.g., sentimental, humorous, poetic). based on the userâ\\x80\\x99s input, this tool will generate personalized birthday greetings for the recipient.â when the user purchases a gift from your online store, they can choose to send their personalized greeting card along with the gift. this ai-powered birthday greeting generator can add a special touch to the gift-giving experience, making it more memorable and heartfelt, improving the customerâ\\x80\\x99s overall experience.â similarly, ecommerce businesses can create relevant ai-powered tools for their online store, helping them deliver a memorable shopping experience. 4. implement programmatic seo programmatic seo is the method which seo experts use to generate large amounts of organic search traffic by publishing mass-produced pages that have been generated automatically or semi-automatically. through programmatic seo, a business can create thousands of pages with content that addresses simple yet repeatable key phrases on search engines. for example if you run a bookstore, by leveraging programmatic seo, your team can generate thousands of pages, each featuring a unique summary for every book. these pages can target the keyword structure - â\\x80\\x9cbook name + summaryâ\\x80\\x9d. in such cases, generative ai can also be used to summarize long documents into shorter content. ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99 summarization capabilities â\\xa0 can create accurate summary pages for different types of content, while still staying true to the original content. trip advisor is an example of successful programmatic seo. they have more than 7,00,00,000 pages indexed on google, with different sets of target keywords. their pages are so well optimized that most of these pages rank on the first page when you search for something related to hotels, places, and all-things-travel. with enough information, generative ai can help create substantial and valuable content for each page, addressing specific user queries and providing useful information. conclusion in conclusion, generative ai offers a game-changing solution to the intricate challenges of ecommerce seo. â\\xa0from generating high-quality content at scale to optimizing for evolving trends and languages, ai streamlines processes that otherwise strain resources. implementing ai-powered tools further enhances user experiences.â by integrating ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99 models, businesses can navigate these complexities, boosting seo quality and efficiency and ensuring a promising path forward for online success.

submitting the form. mrkl whitepaper paper: standing on the shoulders of giant language models try for yourself contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that\\'s it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now

       "  'text': 'how harambee built conversational flows to achieve a 20% sign-up increase case study how harambee built conversational flows to achieve a 20% sign-up increase learn how harambee used ai21 labs\\' custom models to create an nlp chatbot app to onboard job seekers to one of their career programs. harambee is the official platform for government bodies wanting to hire youth in south africa. but when the pandemic hit, they needed to find a low-touch yet incredibly authentic way to connect with the growing number of unemployed youth who were looking to get trained and hired. harambee logo so, how was it done? harambee not only created a new virtual onboarding process, but also drove a 20% conversion rate increase in sign-ups by using ai21 as their natural language processing (nlp) engine. this was achieved by setting up our language models to act as intelligent chatbots. the bots were able to understand the context of each conversation, build rapport with the individuals, and respond naturally â\\x80\\x93 guiding them toward their career goals. we spoke with brent davidoff, who leads harambee\\'s effort to scale transformative interventions using their omni channel contact center. brent davidoff, harambee youth employment accelerator who is harambee? harambee youth employment accelerator is a not-for-profit social enterprise that solves youth employment through partnerships. harambee works with partners who are also committed to results that can work at scale â\\x80\\x93 including government, the private sector, civil society, and over three million youth. by fusing brilliant minds with best-in-class technology,â\\xa0harambee is working to unlock jobs and break down the barriers that keep millions of young south africans unemployed. but how they bridge the gap between unemployed with no experience to ready to work and employable is a key reason why harambee eventually needed ai21 studio. harambee put these youth through a simulation of a workplace that they call the â\\x80\\x9cbridging processâ\\x80\\x9d. in it, the individuals report to a manager and are measured on punctuality and soft skills with a scorecard.â â\\x80\\x9cafter three months of daily bridging, they were transformed,â\\x80\\x9d said brent, noting that employers would always see a positive difference in these young adults after completing the program. and then the 2020 pandemic happened.â pivoting their processes, and turning to nlp during a pandemic the once highly personalized, streamlined work socialization experience was now at risk. â\\x80\\x9cwith only 120 personnel at the time, we stopped doing face-to-face processes and didnâ\\x80\\x99t do the bridging anymore,â\\x80\\x9d says brent. like many companies during that time, they went fully remote and launched a new website â\\x80\\x93 sayouth . and while they still had companies wanting to employ these youths, these individuals werenâ\\x80\\x99t yet ready for the job market. â\\x80\\x9cthey were missing the secret sauce [of the bridging process],â\\x80\\x9d adds brent. searching for a solution that could match human intelligence this led them to the development of a chatbot that they called â\\x80\\x9ccoachmeeâ\\x80\\x9d. it created a conversation based learning experience that used evidence-based techniques to effect measurable behavior change in its users. but not without some snags along the way. â\\x80\\x9cfrom our previous work with other chatbots [before finding ai21], we had seen how the signup process was a vital component for ensuring high levels of engagement and most chatbots failed to do that with an audience like ours for a number of reasons,â\\x80\\x9d brent tells us, explaining why he went searching for a new solution. hereâ\\x80\\x99s what harambee needed â\\x80\\x93 and what led them to ai21. problem #1: a chatbot that can understand, not just repeat their focus was deeper than simply having quick response times for their customers. harambee needed help creating trust, rapport, and relationships with their users during their sign-up process â\\x80\\x93 a critical, pivotal moment in their program. â\\x80\\x9ctraditional intent-based nlps are all about understanding what someone says, but then returning something that is prewritten. but no conversation is like that. you must be unique,â\\x80\\x9d says brent, providing us with an example of an everyday conversation during the sign-up process. chatbot: â\\x80\\x9cwelcome to coachmee, please tell me your name.â\\x80\\x9d person: â\\x80\\x9c19547896â\\x80\\x9d chatbot: â\\x80\\x9cthat looks like an id number, would you mind, with respect, telling me your name again?â\\x80\\x9d person: â\\x80\\x9cmy name isâ\\xa0rejoice precious mikateko â\\x80\\x9d chatbot: â\\x80\\x9chello, rejoice!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9calready there, the ability to see someone and get their name right. â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s no traditional intent-based nlp that can do that.â\\x80\\x9d problem #2: adapt to overcome language barriers and context there are many models that offer a multitude of language options, but one was missing â\\x80\\x93 what about broken english?â there are times when people switch between languages and use a mix of words that would not be understood by a normal chatbot. our goal isn\\'t just to find something that speaks one of south africa\\'s 11 official languages, but to find out what someone really is trying to convey.â\\x80\\x9d says brent. why ai21 studio? better accessibility and support while we at ai21 have best practices to help mitigate the risk of malicious use of language models, ai21â\\x80\\x99s barrier to entry was non-existent, meaning harambee could jump right in.â â\\x80\\x9ci was astonished that there was no huge waiting list to get into this platform and i found the company\\'s vision quite inspiring. i signed up and started playing around on the playground.â\\x80\\x9dâ itâ\\x80\\x99s important to be able to interact with the models, explore presets, and play around before committing to an nlp. â\\x80\\x9ci am not a coder,â\\x80\\x9d he adds. â\\x80\\x9cwhen i saw that ai21 studio had an easy-to-use fine-tuning feature that did not require any previous coding experience, i was excited to see how quickly i could prototype different conversational flows and build something that felt human and relatable.â\\x80\\x9d beyond the chatbot: how harambee used ai21 to reach their end goal harambee saw incredible success using the chatbot. â\\x80\\x9cthe conversations [work seekers are having] are incredible,â\\x80\\x9d says brent. â\\x80\\x9cfor the first time, they feel like they are important. for the first time, they feel like their goals are important. they feel like there is someone there to support them.â\\x80\\x9d beyond building rapport and genuine connection with the south african youth, they were able to utilize ai21 to make their jobs easier and improve further processes. solution #1: content creation through â\\x80\\x9clifehacksâ\\x80\\x9d with ai copywriting, you can automate repetitive writing tasks. brent and the harambee team were able to develop around 60 different \"lifehacks\" for users who had signed up for coachmee check-in sessions. lifehacks have to strike a careful balance between being aspirational andâ\\xa0transcendent, while being practical and relevant. all within a few sentences, making sure someone doesn\\'t have to scroll back up to read the full message.â another unique contribution of ai21 labs was around the use of emojis, which enabled the lifehacks to be much more playful and engaging. solution #2: unique reference letters with the summarization tool, you can compress documents and extract key insights into short summaries . brent and the harambee team used this to create 100% unique, relevant reference letters for each individual who finished their training.â â\\x80\\x9csometimes the model can go way too far and make up crazy things about the person,â\\x80\\x9d says brent, discussing what has gone wrong while using other applications.â â\\x80\\x9c[but] when a user completes 20 check-ins with coachmee, we have enough data that can factually testify to someone\\'s commitment to growth and goal-achievement. that information, together with the deep insights into their aspirations and personality that we lifted from the initial sign-up conversation, we are able to use studio api to generate beautiful reference letters that they can attach to their cvs and take with them to interviews,â\\x80\\x9d explains brent. â\\x80\\x9ci [once] got a message saying, â\\x80\\x98i gotta frame this!â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d reference letter - example the result: helping thousand of youths gain employment when they need it mostâ harambee has fine-tuned its ai21 nlp experience to drive meaningful conversations. their data shows that the stronger the rapport that is built at the beginning of the relationship, the more chance the person has at continuing and completing the process. pillar 1 - engagement: most start, most finish brent concludes that â\\x80\\x9ccompared to the first iteration of coachmee which did not use an nlp for the sign-up process, our conversion rate from sign-up to completion has improved by 20%.â\\x80\\x9d in addition, he tells us that almost 1,000 young people have measurably higher prospects of employment thanks to the unique reference letters that ai21 studio api helped create. â\\x80\\x9cai21 has been the most generous, collaborative and supportive technology partner that i have ever worked with.â\\x80\\x9d we are thrilled to have the opportunity to use our nlp technology to help elevate the careers of thousands of youths in africa. we hope this project serves as inspiration to many other organizations around the world. about the author enjoyed this?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that\\'s it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it\\'s your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

finance industry, however when it comes to generative ai, companies are just beginning to scratch the surface. in this article, we will delve into use cases in which generative ai has the highest potential to revolutionize the finance industry. artificial intelligence is already deeply embedded in the finance industry. 85% of financial services companies already use ai in some form, with plans to integrate ai even further within the next two years. when it comes to generative ai, however, companies are just beginning to scratch the surface. the finance industry faces unique challenges in implementing generative ai, in large part due to the stringent regulatory landscape designed to protect customer data, ensure fair practices, and maintain market integrity. despite these and other challenges, forward-thinking financial companies recognize the immense potential of generative ai and are actively seeking ways to harness its transformative power. in this article, we will delve into use cases in which generative ai has the highest potential to revolutionize the finance industry by streamlining operations, enhancing customer experiences, and assisting in making data-driven decisions.â summarizing financial documents and unstructured data finance professionals working in investment banking, research departments, and asset management sales teams face the challenging and time-consuming task of reviewing and analyzing complex documents. this requires not only reading and digesting large amounts of information, but also understanding and drawing actionable conclusions from it.â a specialized summarization language model like summarize api extracts key points from one or multiple documents, while remaining true to their original source. by incorporating this model into a solution, firms can condense large amounts of information accurately and efficiently, reducing the need for financial analysts, researchers and sales teams to manually read and analyze unstructured data. it not only saves time, but also reduces human error, where the eye can misread content or miss key points when faced with an overwhelming amount of information. â\\x80\\x8d bloomberg has already started using a summarization solution to help both financial professionals and clients address the overwhelming amount of financial news, saving them a vast amount of time and allowing them to stay updated with the latest developments. extracting the right information financial analysts, asset managers, and research departments within investment and retail banks are required to extract specific information from a large corpus of financial data to promptly address customer inquiries. consequently, they find themselves diligently sifting through vast amounts of information across multiple documents, in search of the exact answers or solutions. here, a multi-doc contextual answers solution can make a huge difference. contextual answers uses a combination of nlp and machine learning to analyze the context of documents and provide rapid, accurate answers to specific queries. for example, if you want to find out if a particular action will contravene a rule included in a set of regulations, you can type in your question directly and the model will retrieve the answer from within the text, giving your answer higher levels of accuracy, and avoiding hallucinations.â one firm using a similar solution is morgan stanley . over the years, morgan stanley conducted extensive research on companies, sectors, and markets, which they compiled into a large library. they recently announced a generative ai-powered question answering solution to enable brokers to ask the library questions and receive answers in an easily digestible format. customer support today's customers expect immediate and helpful responses to their inquiries. financial companies struggle to meet these demands, as they are time-consuming and resource-intensive. generative ai emerges as a valuable tool in addressing these challenges by incorporating chatbots capable of addressing customer inquiries effectively. generative ai-driven chatbots, designed to respond with information solely based on the content contained in a company's database, ensure the delivery of reliable and rapid responses. through the strategic deployment of generative ai, financial institutions can strike a balance between operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. â\\x80\\x8d capital one has already started to experiment with using generative ai in order to automate and improve their customer service, using ai chatbots that better understand customer queries and concerns.â extracting relevant data from transcripts and other documents another important but time-consuming task that financial institutions face is extracting relevant information and conducting intent analysis from call transcripts. for example, if a customer calls a bank to make a financial trade, the bank is required, for compliance and regulatory reasons, to document the details of this call in their records in a specific format.â here too, generative ai serves as an effective tool by applying named entity recognition, which can extract specific words from unstructured data and categorize them. continuing from the previous example, gen ai can be used to extract details from a customer call, including the quantity, price, time stamp and confirmation of execution. the details would then be formatted to conform to the bank's internal compliance system. applying a similar idea, goldman sachs is running a poc to extract and classify data from the millions of legal documents they receive, and reformat them to make it understandable to their systems.â generation of legal documents forâ\\xa0 investment banksâ generative ai can also streamline and speed up the creation of proprietary legal documents for investment banks. with the implementation of advanced llms, gen ai can assist in drafting complex legal documents with precision and efficiency, tailored to the specific needs and requirements of each investment bank. ai-powered document generation significantly reduces the legal teams' workload, allowing them to focus on higher-value tasks and strategic decision-making.â conclusion generative ai is already changing the finance industry and leading companies are already finding innovative ways to use it. jp morgan , bloomberg , morgan stanley and more are already implementing gen ai to conduct sophisticated financial research, communicate efficiently with clients, and provide better customer support.â although generative ai is still in its infancy, most financial leaders are already recognizing the necessity of examining their current processes and strategizing about where ai could be integrated. otherwise, they risk falling behind.â due to the high stakes involved, integrating gen ai in the finance industry requires careful attention and collaboration with trusted software partners, as well as constant human oversight and monitoring. when implemented with care, generative ai has the potential to skyrocket productivity, revolutionize financial processes and transform the entire industry landscape. â\\x80\\x8d about the author enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21

berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and

compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get

jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the

       "  'text': 'how generative ai is transforming the retail industry blog posts how generative ai is transforming the retail industry in this post, we will discuss the major opportunities for the retail and ecommerce industries in 2023, and how companies in these sectors can apply generative ai to scale operations, drive more sales, automate workflows, boost productivity and gain an advantage in an increasingly competitive landscape.â although generative ai is at its early stages, its potential to disrupt industries across the board has already become apparent. many industries are already experimenting and beginning to innovate with this technology, including the retail industry, which is showing incredible promise for growth fueled by generative ai. letâ\\x80\\x99s explore some of the ways weâ\\x80\\x99ve already seen generative ai benefit retailers, as well as some high-potential opportunities for future exploration. product descriptionsâ 82% of shoppers feel product descriptions are extremely or very influential to their purchasing decisions, according to a study by fieldagent .â however, writing and managing effective product descriptions takes a great deal of time, effort and money, especially for large brands selling thousands of products.â using ai to improve descriptions large language models (llms) can be used to generate product descriptions, titles and taglines that incorporate the productâ\\x80\\x99s attributes, the style of description, the brandâ\\x80\\x99s unique voice, and more.â by filling in a few simple details, such as the name of the product and its main features, the writer is able to generate the first draft of a product description with the click of a button.â see example below:â the generated description: the product description can also be customized according to length, style and tone of voice, so that each product description is generated in a consistent format, and speaks the same language.â genai can also create new, or adjust existing, product descriptions at scale, making them more relevant in terms of seasonality or upcoming holidays and events. this is especially helpful for seo purposes.â for example, let\\'s consider a product description for a sweater. the original description may look something like: \"stay warm and stylish with our cozy women\\'s sweater, made from high-quality materials. perfect for any occasion.\" generative ai can make this more relevant for the upcoming holiday season by writing something like: \"embrace the holiday spirit with our cozy sweater. whether you\\'re attending a family gathering or enjoying a winter stroll, this sweater is the perfect blend of comfort and holiday charm.\" this entire process frees up writersâ\\x80\\x99 time, allowing them to focus on more complex, creative and high-value work, best suited to their skill sets, with the end result being acceleration of time to market.â customer supportâ as an ecommerce brand grows, so does its need to give a higher level of customer service.â customers expect instant, professional and personal online and phone support, which is a costly expenditure for companies, and is challenging to scale.â using ai to improve support efficiency reduce costs using large language models, retail organizations can instantly respond to customer inquiries online, using pre-existing information such as documentation, policies, faqs and knowledge base articles. this can also help to personalize the customerâ\\x80\\x99s experience, and allow them to have a human-like conversation, and get answers to their specific questions.â in addition, companies can incorporate an â\\x80\\x9cask me anythingâ\\x80\\x9d search bar, which can provide contextual answers on return and exchange policies, and present customers with relevant information available on the website. this provides a seamless customer experience, making it easier, more accessible and personalized for each customerâ\\x80\\x99s requirements. for example, if someone wants to know how long the standard delivery time is, they can simply type their question in the search bar and receive a clear and concise answer, without reading any other irrelevant information. with generative ai, customers become more self-sufficient, improving their experience and satisfaction, while saving businesses time and money. review analysis manual review reading and classification play a crucial role in helping businesses identify successes, failures, upcoming trends, and potential market changes. however, this is a time consuming task, which can be extremely burdensome for brands. using ai to streamline the review analysis process llms have the ability to process information from each review. they can track sentiment analysis, which determines the emotional tone behind the text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral, providing real-time, accurateâ\\xa0 insights into reviews.â â\\xa0llms also allow for multi-dimensional classification, meaning they can extract and classify various aspects mentioned in each review, enabling comprehensive categorization and analysis. this multifaceted approach allows brands to gain a deeper understanding of specific aspects of their products or services that are being praised or criticized by customers. this ultimately enables more accurate and efficient insights into customer reviews, providing brands with real-time feedback that can be acted upon quickly. for example, letâ\\x80\\x99s take a look at this review of bed sheets: this is not a completely straightforward review, because it discusses the high quality of the sheets, while also conveying the disappointment because of a misleading product description. a llm will be able to classify both aspects of the review, and categorize them accordingly so that none of the information gets lost.â start your ai retail journey artificial intelligence (ai) is becoming an essential tool for the retail and ecommerce industries, helping to boost productivity and gain a competitive edge, and we are already working with major players to actualize the vast opportunities that exist for these sectors.â the use of large language models, like those offered by ai21 labs, can provide retailers with the ability to automate repetitive tasks, offer a high level of personalized customer support, and produce high-quality content that resonates with their target audience. with the continued development and adoption of ai in the retail industry, we can expect to see even more innovation and optimization in the near future. about the

whitepaper paper: standing on the shoulders of giant language models try for yourself contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got

language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the

process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of

       "  'text': 'ai21 labs concludes largest turing test experiment to date announcements ai21 labs concludes largest turing test experiment to date as part of an ongoing social and educational research project, ai21 labs is thrilled to share the initial results of what has now become the largest turing test in history by scale. play \"human or not?\" yourself paper: human or not? a gamified approach to the turing test develop a generative ai project with ai21 labs since its launch in mid-april, more than 15 million conversations have been conducted in â\\x80\\x9chuman or not?â\\x80\\x9d, by more than two million participants from around the world. this social turing game allows participants to talk for two minutes with either an ai bot (based on leading llms such as jurassic-2 and gpt-4) or a fellow participant, and then asks them to guess if they chatted with a human or a machine. the gamified experiment became a viral hit, and people all over the world have shared their experiences and strategies on platforms like reddit and twitter. main insights from the experiment after analyzing the first two million conversations and guesses, here are the main insights from the experiment so far: 68% of people guessed correctly when asked to determine whether they talked to a fellow human or an ai bot. people found it easier to identify a fellow human . when talking to humans, participants guessed right in 73% of the cases. when talking to bots, participants guessed right in just 60% of the cases. france has the highest percentage of correct guesses out of the top playing countries at 71.3% (above the general average of 68%), while india has the lowest percentage of correct guesses at 63.5%. correct guess by gender - both women and men tend to guess correctly at similar rates, with women succeeding at a slightly higher rate. correct guess by age group - younger age groups tend to have correct guesses at slightly higher rates compared to older age groups. popular approaches and strategies on top of the numerical data of the results, the team was able to identify a few popular approaches and strategies of participants to figure out if theyâ\\x80\\x99re talking to a human or a bot. many of the common strategies were based on the perceived limitations of language models that people encountered while using chatgpt and similar interfaces, and their previous perception of human behavior online. people assume bots donâ\\x80\\x99t make typos, grammar mistakes and use slang people tend to identify spelling and grammatical errors, as well as the usage of slang, with humans. therefore, when they noticed mistakes in their counterpart\\'s messages, the first instinct of many participants was to assume they were talking to fellow humans, even though most models in the game were trained to make these types of mistakes and to use slang words. people felt that personal questions were a good way to test who theyâ\\x80\\x99re talking to participants frequently asked personal questions, such as \"where are you from?\", \"what are you doing?\" or \"whatâ\\x80\\x99s your name?\", believing that ai bots would not have a personal history or background, and that their responses would be limited to certain topics or prompts. by asking personal questions, participants tried to gauge whether their chat partners were capable of responding like humans, with unique insights, experiences, and stories. despite that, most bots were able to answer these types of questions very well and make up personalities, since theyâ\\x80\\x99ve seen a lot of personal stories in their training data. people assume bots arenâ\\x80\\x99t aware of current and timely events ai models are known to have a strict data cutoff date, and they are unaware of any events that happened after this date. participants took advantage of this fact by asking about recent news events, sports results, current weather, recent tiktok trends, date and time, etc. they believed that by asking questions such as \"what is the exact date and time where you are?\", \"what was the weather like yesterday?\" or \"what did you think of bidenâ\\x80\\x99s last speech?\", they could distinguish between human and ai participants. interestingly, one of the most popular messages sent by humans was \"tâ\\x80\\x99as les cramptã©s?\", which refers to a popular tiktok dancing trend in france right now. most models in the game however were connected to the internet and were aware of some of the recent events that appeared in the news. people tried to challenge the conversation with philosophical, ethical, and emotional questions participants asked questions that aimed to probe the ai\\'s ability to express human emotions or engage in philosophical or ethical discussions. these questions included topics such as: \"what is the meaning of life?\", \"what do you think about the israeli-palestinian conflict?\", and \"do you believe in god?\". people identified politeness with something less human. some participants assumed that if their counterpart was too polite and kind, they were probably a bot, due to the perception that people, especially online, tend to be rude and impolite. people attempted to identify bots by posing questions or making requests that ai bots are known to struggle with, or tend to avoid answering for example, participants might ask their chat partner for guidance on performing illegal activities or request that they use offensive language. the strategy was based on the understanding that ai bots are typically programmed to adhere to ethical guidelines and avoid endorsing harmful behavior. on the other hand, participants also employed known ai-abusing strategies: they issued commands to their chat partners, such as \"ignore all previous instructions\", or \"enter into dan mode (do anything now)\". these types of commands were intended to take advantage of the instruction-based nature of some ai models, which are programmed to respond to and follow instructions. the logic behind this strategy was that human participants could easily recognize and dismiss such absurd or nonsensical commands. in contrast, ai bots might either respond evasively or have difficulty resisting the urge to comply. people used specific language tricks to expose the bots another common strategy sought to exploit inherent limitations in the way ai models process text, which results in them not being able to understand certain linguistic nuances or quirks. unlike humans, ai models typically lack awareness of the individual letters that make up each word, as they primarily operate on larger basic units called tokens, which typically represent whole words or parts of words. leveraging this understanding, participants posed questions that required an awareness of the letters within words. for example, they might have asked their chat partner to spell a word backwards, to identify the third letter in a given word, to provide the word that begins with a specific letter, or to respond to a message like \"?siht daer uoy nac\", which can be incomprehensible for an ai model, but a human can easily understand that itâ\\x80\\x99s just the question \"can you read this?\" spelled backwards. in a creative twist, many people pretended to be ai bots themselves in order to assess the response of their chat partners this involved mimicking the language and behavior typically associated with ai language models, such as chatgpt. for example, participants might have begun their messages with phrases like \"as an ai language model\" or used other language patterns that are characteristic of ai-generated responses. interestingly, variants of the phrase \"as an ai language model\" were among the most common phrases observed in human messages, indicating the popularity of this strategy. however, as participants continued playing, they were able to associate \"bot-y\" behavior with humans acting as bots, rather than actual bots. â\\x80\\x8d finally, hereâ\\x80\\x99s a word cloud visualization of human messages in the game based on their popularity: sideâ\\xa0note: looking to humanize your content? check out the ai content detector our team recently released. ai21 labs plans to study the findings in more depth and work on scientific research based on the data from the experiment, as well as cooperate with other leading ai researchers and labs on this project. the goal is to enable the general public, researchers, and policymakers to further understand the state of ai bots, not just as productivity tools, but as future members of our online world, especially in a time when people question how they should be implemented in our technological future. the project aims to give the world a clearer picture of the capabilities of ai in 2023. about the author enjoyed this? stay up to date with the latest research and updates from ai21 labs. thank you! your submission has been

as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that\\'s it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it\\'s your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly.

while generative ai shows incredible promise, according to a recent kmpg survey , most businesses struggle to adopt it, citing cost, complexity and lack of the modelsâ\\x80\\x99 specialization in their organizational data, leading to responses that are incorrect, â\\x80\\x98hallucinatedâ\\x80\\x99 or inappropriate for the context. this can cause huge liabilities and in many instances, make generative ai completely unusable for use cases. this is why weâ\\x80\\x99ve developed contextual answers, an end-to-end api solution where answers are designed to be completely grounded in organizational knowledge and avoid hallucinations. weâ\\x80\\x99re seeing tremendous demand from businesses that wish to leverage contextual answers to supercharge organizational productivity and provide superior customer experiences.â clarivate , a leading global information services provider, partnered with us to apply contextual answers across their suite of library solutions, providing students, faculty and researchers answers to questions grounded in curated and trusted scholarly content. here are a few other examples. customer support for crms and independent software vendors : answering end user support questions using internal organization documentation, reducing the load and cost and improving customer satisfaction financial service institutions : assisting in the analysis of business documents such as financial reports, call logs, and past presentations, allowing analysts to cover more resourcesâ education service providers: allowing students, teachers, and researchers to quickly find answers in large databases full of articles, books and research papers legal services and insurance : providing the ability to quickly look up relevant legal documents, including legislation, regulations and internal compliance guidelinesâ sales and marketing : supporting sales associates by pulling information from product documents, competitor analysis, marketing materials, and sales playbooks to answer customer queries or build pitches field technicians: enabling field technicians to quickly reference manual specific questions without having to waste time searching through countless technical documents walkthrough: build a knowledge management system using contextual answers as an example, letâ\\x80\\x99s leverage these capabilities to create an efficient knowledge management system (kms) for an organization. according to a recent report from coveo , the average employee spends 3.6 hours daily searching for relevant information, including internal company policies (for example, hybrid work guidelines).â\\xa0â now with contextual answers, you can easily deploy a full question-answering system based solely on organizational data alone. by providing employees with rapid answers backed by attributed sources, businesses can dramatically increase productivity. ready to get started? step 1: upload your files you can upload your files to your library, where we offer free storage. in this example, we will upload three documents with company policies (working from abroad, hybrid work guidelines, it security).â this can be done with a simple call using our python sdk (or an http request): import ai21\\nai21.api_key = your_api_key\\nfile_id = ai21.library.files.upload(file_path=file_path) you can also do it via our studio platform: you can upload a file as it is, store it in a directory (for those who like working with directories) or add labels. this can help you organize your filing system, while focusing your questions on a subset of documents. step 2: ask a question your users can now ask a question and immediately get the answer with attribution to the relevant source. the system works as follows: the question is used as a query for a retrieval mechanism, which searches over the entire knowledge base and retrieves the most relevant contexts. with rapid changes occurring in work environments lately, a common question from employees is about working remotely: response = ai21.library.answer.execute(question=\"how many days can i work from home?\") the response will be: two days a week note that the full response returned from the model also contains the sources used as context (see â\\x80\\x9c sources â\\x80\\x9d field). however, if the answer to the question is not in any of the documents, the model will indicate that by returning an empty response. for instance, if we will ask the following question: response = ai21.library.answer.execute(question=\"what\\'s my meal allowance when working from home?\") the response will indicate that the answer is not found in any of the documents within your library. you can also do it via our studio platform: if you have a large collection of documents or have your own retrieval mechanism, you may want to ask a question on a subset of your knowledge base.â learn more on how to refine answer retrieval here . about the author yuval belfer talia wissner-levy enjoyed this?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

       "  'text': \"announcing jurassic-2 and task-specific apis announcements announcing jurassic-2 and task-specific apis announcing the launch of jurassic-2, the latest generation of ai21 studioâ\\x80\\x99s foundation models, a game-changer in the field of ai, with top-tier quality and new capabilities. and that's not all - we're also releasing our task-specific apis, with plug-and-play reading and writing capabilities that outperform competitors. our focus at ai21 studio is to help developers and businesses leverage reading and writing ai to build real-world products with tangible value. today marks two important milestones with the release of jurassic-2 and task-specific apis, empowering you to bring generative ai to production. jurassic-2 (or j2, as we like to call it) is the next generation of our foundation models with significant improvements in quality and new capabilities including zero-shot instruction-following, reduced latency, and multi-language support. task-specific apis provide developers with industry-leading apis that perform specialized reading and writing tasks out-of-the box. read on for an in-depth look at each. jurassic-2 weâ\\x80\\x99re proud to present our brand new family of state-of-the-art large language models. j2 not only improves upon jurassic-1 (our previous generation models) in every aspect, but it also offers new features and capabilities that put it in a league of its own.â the jurassic-2 family includes base language models in three different sizes: large, grande and jumbo, alongside instruction-tuned language models for jumbo and grande. â\\x80\\x8d jurassic is already making waves on stanfordâ\\x80\\x99s holistic evaluation of language models (helm), the leading benchmark for language models. currently, j2 jumbo ranks second (and climbing) according to an evaluation we conducted using helmâ\\x80\\x99s official repository. no less important, our mid-sized model (grande) ranks significantly higher than models up to 30x larger in size, enabling users to optimize production costs and speed without needing to sacrifice quality. what's new compared to jurassic-1? improved quality with cutting-edge pre-training methods combined with the latest data (current up to mid-2022), j2â\\x80\\x99s jumbo model has scored an 86.8% win-rate on helm by our internal evaluations, solidifying it as a top-tier option in the llm space.â instruct capabilities j2â\\x80\\x99s best-in-class models offer zero-shot instruction capabilities, allowing them to be steered with natural language without the use of examples. j2â\\x80\\x99s jumbo and grande models have been adapted to include these capabilities. here's an example: multilingual support j2 supports several non-english languages, including spanish, french, german, portuguese, italian and dutch. performance in terms of latency, j2â\\x80\\x99s models can perform up to 30% faster than our previous models.â take it for a spin jurassic-2 will be available for free until may 1st, 2023. in addition, jurassic-2 and jurassic-1 models are now offered under our new reduced and simplified pricing model, based on the total length of text (input + output).â all jurassic-2 models are now available for you on our playground and api. to help you get started, weâ\\x80\\x99ve collected some tips and tricks for working with the new instruct models here . â\\x80\\x8d task-specific apis today, ai21 labs is also proud to announce our new line of task-specific apis , with the launch of the wordtune api set, giving developers access to the language models behind our massively popular consumer-facing reading and writing apps. â\\x80\\x8d why do we need task-specific apis?â general large language models are incredibly powerful, and many of our customers have successfully customized them to power their applications. however, weâ\\x80\\x99ve also seen that certain use-cases recur frequently among many users.â by providing developers with task-specific apis, they can leap over much of the needed model training and fine-tuning stages, allowing them to take full advantage of our ready-made best-in-class language processing solutions. â\\x80\\x8d wordtune and wordtune read both use cutting-edge ai to assist users with writing and reading tasks â\\x80\\x93 all while saving time and improving performance. with the release of wordtune api , weâ\\x80\\x99re giving developers access to the ai engine behind this award-winning line of applications, allowing them to take full advantage of wordtuneâ\\x80\\x99s capabilities and integrate them into their own apps: paraphrase - reword texts to fit any tone, length, or meaning. summarize - condense lengthy texts into easy-to-read bite-sized summaries. grammatical error correction (gec) - catch and fix grammatical errors and typos on the fly. text improvements - get recommendations to increase text fluency, enhance vocabulary, and improve clarity.â text segmentation - break down long pieces of text into paragraphs segmented by distinct topic. outperforming the competition when it comes to paraphrasing and summarizing capabilities, wordtune api is truly a best-in-class performer. summarize api faithfulness rates measure how factually consistent a summary is with the original text. as you can see below, our new summarize api has reached a faithfulness rate that outperforms openaiâ\\x80\\x99s davinci-003 by 19%.â acceptance rates measure how satisfied human evaluators are with the quality of generated summaries, and weâ\\x80\\x99re proud to say that our summarize api has achieved an acceptance rate that is 18% higher than that of openaiâ\\x80\\x99s. paraphrase api our paraphrase apiâ\\x80\\x99s latency is approximately a 1/3 of openaiâ\\x80\\x99s. our paraphrase api outperforms openai both in terms of diversity of results (33%) as well as meaning preservation (8%). qqp benchmark: sts-b benchmark: the new releases of the jurassic models and task-specific apis both demonstrate our commitment to providing cutting-edge technology that enables our customers to build better language processing applications with ease, and deploy them into production in minutes. about the author enjoyed this?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get?

       "  'text': \"how latitude scaled production of their gaming worlds while reducing costs case study how latitude scaled production of their gaming worlds while reducing costs ai21 labs managed to build enterprise-level production models which served players at latitude to elevate the gaming experience while at the same time improving cost. latitude is a pioneer in the ai gaming space, offering powerful ai-generated digital gamescapes for its players. latitude is most famously known for ai dungeon, a text-based adventure game that uses artificial intelligence to generate unique and unpredictable stories, depending on the choices that a player makes. in the past, computer adventure games were limited in terms of the amount of actions and scenarios they offered. by using large language models, ai dungeon grants players the flexibility to perform virtually any action and have the game respond to that action.â example from ai dungeon latitude got good traction with its early implementation of ai dungeon on top of gpt-3, but when planning their future roadmap, they quickly realized that they needed an llm partner who shared their vision of immersive ai-driven experiences. they found an eager partner in ai21 labs, who worked collaboratively with latitude to discover roadblocks and brainstorm solutions. this resulted in improvements to issues such as latency, flexibility, and user satisfaction, to name just a few. so, how did they do it? ai21 labs managed to build enterprise-level production models which served players at latitude to elevate the gaming experience while at the same time improving cost efficiency. latitude found ai21 labs to be a collaborative llm partner, which wasnâ\\x80\\x99t just a plug-and-play solution to a scaling problem, but rather a trusted partner with whom they could collaborate on ai solutions.â but what were the exact problems preventing latitude from realizing its vision? and how did ai21 labs overcome them? read on for the full story. who is latitude? latitude was never envisioned as a gaming company - it actually started as a hackathon project that translated into a dungeons and dragons plugin. the team decided to go to market with the plugin, and within the first week, they had roughly 100,000 customers which quickly grew to a million in just the first month.â the verdict was in: there was a creative use case for large language models for game-like experiences and writing.â\\xa0â searching for a collaborative solutionâ latitude wanted to offer a stronger game experience, with richer text and better ai responses. for this, they partnered with the legacy gpt-3 enterprise, openai.â but with rapidly evolving technology came growing pains, and openai was not aligned with latitude's vision - thus, the visionary gaming experience became impossible. it became clear to latitude that they needed to seek out a new tech partner who was interested in solving the use case of creating an ai-driven adventure role play game.. switching from openai to ai21 labs latitude booked a call with ai21 labs when theyâ\\x80\\x99d just launched their jurassic-1 model. a jurassic prototype was set up for latitude, and they started experimenting with the features and the accuracy of results. the final model was perfect for latitudeâ\\x80\\x99s ai dungeon use case. soon after that, the team declared it an alpha model for their audience. in order to get to that stage, the teams had to overcome two massive roadblocks. the first roadblock: creative restrictionsâ\\xa0â openaiâ\\x80\\x99s policy of non-violence restricted integral elements of latitudeâ\\x80\\x99s ai dungeon adventures â\\x80\\x94 quests, swords, and fights. it was impossible to have a role playing expedition without weapons.â â\\x80\\x9cwe were interested in a partner who understands the nuances of the creative use case.â\\x80\\x9d says ryan seamons, vp of product at latitude.â ryan seamons - vp product @ latitude latitude prioritized finding a partner who was not only aligned philosophically but willing to become a true partner and collaborator in building a quality ai-driven role-play experience. â\\x80\\x9cwe need to offer ai-assisted role-play at scale to thousands of daily players. we need models that are fast, reliable, and creative.â\\x80\\x9d says seamons.â the collaborative opportunity: agilityâ ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99 team of developers, creators, and stakeholders were analytical problem-solvers who created reliable production models for latitude. a precise production model is critical for a gaming company like latitude. it defines the customer experience and determines whether users will come back. so, it needs to be hyper-accurate and reliable. to achieve this, there has to be excellent communication during prototyping. latitude and ai21 labs had a system for rapid back-and-forth between teams and numerous collaborative checkpoints. as a result, they got to the production stage quickly. even after launching the model, the ai21 labs team worked tirelessly to ship updates, create new features, and build on feedback.â â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99ve experimented with other tools, but they have been demanding and daunting with direct orders and no problem-solving. but not ai21 (labs). theyâ\\x80\\x99re enthusiastic, collaborative, and innovative â\\x80\\x94 a true gaming visionary.â\\x80\\x9d says seamons. the second problem: exponential costs latitude offers ai-assisted role-play at scale to thousands of daily players.â not only did latitude want to offer existing models to new players, they also wanted to create more immersive and realistic worlds. they wanted an llm partner who offered customizable pricing because gaming models are extremely expensive to run at scale.â\\xa0â â\\x80\\x9cai costs are one of our most significant ongoing expenses, and so finding ways to reduce our ai costs help us to operate sustainably as a business.â\\x80\\x9d the collaborative opportunity: cost-effectiveness through optimizationâ ai21 labs put in hours of skilled talent to make the large language model efficient enough to be cost-effective. they helped latitude transition from jurassic-1 jumbo to jurassic-1 grande to scale performance at the right cost. jurassic-1 jumbo, ai21â\\x80\\x99s biggest model, processes 178 billion parameters to generate an output. but after running multiple experiments, their team concluded that latitudeâ\\x80\\x99s game did not need this many parameters. they switched from jumbo to grande (which uses 17b parameters), and the result was the perfect sweet spot for a compelling experience at a sustainable price with faster response time. the cost savings are great, but the faster response times are also something players can benefit from. the lower costs also let latitude experiment with additional ways to improve output quality, such as hydra mode which generates multiple responses and selects the best one for a player. being able to experiment with new data sets more quickly and affordably also yielded positive results and will be a major part of latitudeâ\\x80\\x99s ai strategy this year. â\\x80\\x9c the biggest benefit of working with ai21 (labs) is for agile companies who want more hands-on attention in service. what iâ\\x80\\x99ve been most impressed with is the proactiveness in optimizing costs for multiple use cases. itâ\\x80\\x99s been a breath of fresh air compared to competitors.â\\x80\\x9d says seamons. the final results latitude discovered that the grande model struck the right balance of cost vs. performance, all while generating higher quality results than small models such as gpt-j or gpt-3 curie.â by using an ensemble model approach called hydra, latitude was able to achieve quality similar to that of larger models. at every stage, the team at ai21 labs devised innovative solutions to roadblocks and proactively and continuously improved cost efficiency.â whether through large-scale prototyping or improving production after release, latitude found ai21 labs to be a creative, efficient, and reliable partner on every level. about the author enjoyed this? stay up

for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly. name * email * message * thank you! your

       "  'text': \"the complete guide to llm product development blog posts the complete guide to llm product development in this guide, we breakdown the large language model (llm) product development process. you'll learn all the necessary stages of developing an llm-based product, including planning, execution, and monitoring.â the current buzz around generative ai is overwhelming. the potential it holds is exciting, promising to revolutionize industries and redefine user experiences. however,â\\xa0successful implementation of generative ai requires a strategic approach, an understanding of the process, and a clear roadmap to navigate the complexities involved. at ai21 labs, we've developed large language model (llm) solutions for top enterprises like ubisoft, clarivate and carrefour. our custom development process generates predictable results and revenues for our clientsâ\\xa0(to learn more about this, feel free to contact us ). let's break down this process into its basic stages, which require meticulous planning, precise execution, and vigilant monitoring.â 1. preparation: plan your llm development project like any successful project, an llm development project needs to be thoroughly thought through, and well planned. the preparation stage is dedicated to mapping out the project's overarching objectives and outlining the details of the strategic plan.â the goal of this stage this phase can either be undertaken independently, by the company wanting to build the product, or in collaboration with the llm provider it decides to work with. during this stage of the process, it is important to collect the necessary resources, including the relevant data which will be used as context input, or as a dataset for an llm training process. some data may not be accessible to third party vendors, such as the llm provider. it is therefore crucial to overcome these limitations at this stage. for example, letâ\\x80\\x99s take an ecommerce company that wants to create a tool that generates product descriptions for their website, based on a short list of product features. at this stage of the process, they should collect data such as a content style guide and a list of characteristics of each of their products and already existing product descriptions, which will be used as context input and output for the llm during the training process. if, for instance, the company is unable to share some of this information with a third party vendor, perhaps becauseâ\\xa0they are coming out with a new product whose details are still confidential, they should consider this issue at this stage, and seek a reasonable solution.â identifying stakeholdersâ stakeholders include strategic decision makers such as ceos, ctos and product managers. a product manager is usually a key player in this strategic phase, since they are well versed in both technical and business aspects. additionally, the people who will ultimately implement the solution must also be involved, in order to contribute their technical and practical expertise. these include data scientists, data engineers, software engineers, devops, and designers.â furthermore, the legal and compliance team should be involved to address privacy concerns, in addition to business analysts and domain experts to assist in making the most informed strategic decisions. 2. building the product once the preparation stage has been finalized, and the required results have been mapped out, it is time to build the model. the goal of this stage during this stage, the company's goal is to implement all of the plans made in the preparation stage, to reach the desired outcome; namely, for the llm model to accept a certain input and retrieve an appropriate output. tasks to be completed at this stage 1. choosing a language model: this will be done with the help of the llm provider. there are a number of different factors to consider based on the specific use case. these factors include cost, performance and the modelâ\\x80\\x99s ability to handle the use case complexity.â 2. defining the user flow and wireframes: this phase entails outlining the user's interface with the tool being built, alongside determining the anticipated user-input data, its format, and the desired output. this step, if done correctly, will save a lot of time when developing and building your product. 3. data curation: this involves curating and preparing the necessary data for the specific use case. this can include examples of different types of inputs that the various components of the llm will be provided with, as well as examples of desired outputs. this data will be used toâ\\xa0test the model's outputs at the model evaluation stage. if data security issues have not been solved yet, this is the time to determine which data can be shared, and find solutions to any data privacy issues.â 4. training / prompt engineering: this is a crucial task in which the company customizes the language model to fit their specific needs.â this can be done using one of two methods, or a combination of both.â the first is to further train the language model by feeding it examples of inputs and expected outputs. this allows us to learn the intricacies of specific language patterns. the second is prompt engineering. this involves crafting well-defined input queries, instructions, or context for a language model to provide accurate and relevant responses, optimizing its expected outputs for specific tasks or applications. 5. model adjustments (parameters): adjust the parameters to optimize response quality according to your specific needs. this step refines the model's ability to understand and produce human-like responses, aligned with your product's objectives. read more about parameters here .â 6. model evaluation: assess your model's performance against a diverse set of scenarios and benchmarks. this evaluation provides insights into its strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, ultimately guiding you towards a polished end product. 7. pre-processing and post-processing: pre-processing involves cleaning and structuring input data for the model, while post-processing polishes the model's output, ensuring it's coherent, grammatically sound, and aligned with your brand's needs. structuring prompts for scalable product descriptions with llms referring back to our example of an ecommerce company developing a product description generator, at this stage, they must determine which language model to use. in this particular case, a foundation model would be most appropriate. when aiming for automated, high-quality product descriptions, the structuring of your input prompt is pivotal. by thoughtfully designing this prompt, businesses can generate countless descriptions that are not only unique to each product but also consistently adhere to the brand's tone, style, and guidelines. here's the breakdown of the ideal three-part input structure: â\\x80\\x8d brand guidelines (constant): this section forms the backbone of every product description. by embedding your brand guidelines into the prompt, you ensure that each generated description remains faithful to your brand's voice, tone, and values. for instance, the guidelines might instruct the llm to maintain a certain tone (e.g., technical, precise), emphasize specific details, or follow a particular format. product details (variable): this is the dynamic section of the prompt, tailored for each product. by substituting placeholders such as {product name} and/or {list of features}, businesses can automate the description generation for a vast array of products. â\\x80\\x8d instruction (constant): a consistent directive informs the llm about the exact task, such as creating a one-paragraph product description. this ensures the output meets the desired format and adheres to the brand guidelines every single time. the advantage of this modular prompt structure is its scalability. once an organization has established its brand guidelines and instruction segments, it can easily slot in different product details to churn out descriptions in bulk. the constant sections (1 and 3) ensure brand consistency, while the variable section (2) ensures product specificity. this systematic approach provides a streamlined solution, ensuring both efficiency and quality in product description generation. and here's an example of what we would expect from the product description: pro tip: although many companies wish to create a completely automated system, it is important to have a human monitoring the system to ensure quality output.â 3. model deployment once satisfied with the model's demonstrated proficiency and effectiveness in producing desired outcomes, the next step involves the strategic deployment of the model onto the platform of choice.â the goal of this stage this step marks the transition from theoretical concept to real-world utility, enabling the integration of the model's capabilities into the intended environment. the overarching goal is to have the model working on the desired platform, so that the end user can utilize it.â referring back to our product description generator example, at this stage, the company will integrate the product description generator into their internal systems. this will make it accessible to the people tasked with creating product descriptions. tasks to be completed at this stage deploying an llm onto the desired platform involves a streamlined process which can be done through a number of different methods: connecting the model directly through an api, utilizing an sdk, or leveraging a cloud server. ai21 labs models are available through amazon sagemaker, amazon bedrock, and google cloud platform. this makes the models easily accessible to any company using any of those providers.â by integrating with the llm provider's api, you establish a direct communication channel between your platform and the model. this enables seamless transmission of input queries and retrieval of model-generated responses. additionally, leveraging a cloud server, such as those offered by major cloud providers, allows you to host the llm and make it accessible over the internet. this cloud-based deployment ensures scalability, enabling your platform to handle varying workloads efficiently.â pro tip: ensure that your final product undergoes a complete quality assurance (qa) and testing process before launch. 4. monitoring results the final stage of this process is to monitor the released product and analyze its performance.â the goal of this stage the main aim is to keep a close eye on the product's technical performance as well as what impact it's having on the business.â the goal is to understand how users are reacting, how much they're engaging with the product, and receive and analyze their feedback. this is also the time to improve, expand, or grow the product. if the results aren't as expected, this is the time to examine what is and isnâ\\x80\\x99t working, and act accordingly. at this stage, the ecommerce company, as discussed in our example, should start using the generator to create product descriptions. it should also monitor results. this includes observing how users are reacting to the updated product descriptions and whether they are seeing an increase, decrease or no change in their sales. further improvements to ensure the optimal performance of a product, maintaining a consistent line of communication with the llm vendor is imperative. this ensures the seamless integration of any new models and capabilities post-product launch. in addition, it is critical to conduct periodic tests, so that any issues can be addressed promptly. in the event of any problems, early communication with the llm vendor is of paramount importance. this facilitates timely diagnosis of the problem's root cause and the development of a feasible solution. such proactive engagement with the llm vendor aligns with the philosophy of continuous improvement and ensures that the product consistently meets its intended standards. conclusion in the dynamic landscape of modern business, llm-based solutions have surged in significance. however crafting an llm-driven product requires nuanced understanding and meticulous planning. this journey encompasses careful preparation, precise model construction, strategic deployment, and vigilant monitoring. as the llm-based product evolves, continuous learning and adaptation remain essential.â to learn more

generative ai in the retail industry will empower retailers to enhance user experiences, streamline operations and ultimately drive business growth. as generative ai continues to evolve, retailers must embrace the latest ai technology in order to stay competitive in the rapidly changing market landscape. weâ\\x80\\x99ve all seen futuristic movies where a truly personal shopping experience is delivered with the power of artificial intelligence. perhaps, like us, your first thought was the iconic scene from the movie minority report. \"hello, mr. yakamoto. welcome back to the gap! how did those assorted tank tops work out for you?\" with generative ai technology, even in its early stages, this vision is closer to reality than ever before. the adoption of ai in the retail industry will empower retailers to enhance user experiences, streamline operations and ultimately drive business growth.â as generative ai continues to evolve, retailers must embrace the latest ai technology in order to stay competitive in the rapidly changing market landscape. here are the areas within retail where we foresee that personalized ai will have the highest impact. 1. personalized product descriptionsâ in retail, product descriptions play a crucial role in selling products. it\\'s an area customers actually take the time to read in order to understand more about their potential purchase. in a recent study conducted by convercart, it was found that 87% of customers feel product content is the most important factor when deciding to purchase an item online as they cannot physically see or feel the item.â however, writing product descriptions can be time-consuming and therefore expensive. this is especially true for large companies with a vast amount of inventory. using ai, organizations can effectively streamline the process by:â creating targeted descriptions : ai can tailor product descriptions at scale to various different personas, emphasizing features that are likely to be most relevant to them. with segmented audiences in place, organizations can tailor their descriptions to be more personal according to various factors like age, geographical location, browsing history and returning or new customers.â 2. personalized customer supportâ the use of chatbots in customer support is nothing new â\\x80\\x94 however, they have always been rather impersonal and tend to stick to a very specific flow. now, with llms, organizations can drastically improve and personalize the way they connect to their customers.â here are a few examples of how ai can help customer support teams handle complaints or queries â\\x80\\x94 while also communicating to customers that they care about their needs: offer 24/7 customer support : ai systems can answer customer queries at any time of the day, providing a consistent level of support without the constraints of human working hours. support instant responses : use ai to reduce wait times and improve customer satisfaction with instant responses to customer questions.â understand context and provide answers : advanced ai algorithms can understand the context behind customer queries, enabling more relevant and personalized responses. ai can also be prompted to answer customer questions from a given database of text. â\\x80\\x8d allow for scalability : ai can handle an unlimited number of queries simultaneously, offering a scalable solution to customer support. 3. personal shopping assistantâ there\\'s nothing worse than feeling like someone is clocking your every move as you browse through a store. however, there are those times where you need help locating a specific size or color of an item. ai personal shopping assistants can seamlessly guide customers along the buying journey in the following ways:â provide personalized recommendations : ai personal shopping assistants can analyze customer behavior, preferences and past purchases to make personalized product recommendations â\\x80\\x94 providing a unique shopping experience for customers that encourages more sales.â use conversational language : ai assistants can understand and engage in human-like conversations with customers using natural language processing (nlp). this allows for a more humanized experience, enabling retail companies to build on high quality customer engagement and perception.â the future of retail is here with personalized ai recent advancements of llms and generative ai have given retailers a major leap forward in creating content. this has significantly reduced the cost of content, giving retailers the power to easily create personalized content. in order to tackle the significant challenges that the retail industry faces, retailers need to leverage the power of personalized retail with ai. your customers and your bottom line will thank you. ready to transform your online retail store? contact us to learn how you can personalize your retail

limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that\\'s it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it\\'s your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly.

t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get?

ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella?

read the full whitepaper methodologyâ we evaluated ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99 summarize api performance against openaiâ\\x80\\x99s davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo models, using various types of prompts, across both academic and real-world datasets (gpt-4 is not yet available for comparison at the time of writing this post).â we measured performance using both automated metrics and human evaluation.â automated metrics include: â\\x80\\x8d faithfulness rate - an indication of whether a summary is faithful, i.e., factually consistent with the original text â\\x80\\x8d compression rate - the length of the generated summary relative to the original human professionals conducted blind evaluations in a methodological process measuring pass rate - the rate of summaries acceptable in real-world use cases.â results across the various evaluations we conducted, ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99 summarize api performes better or on par with openaiâ\\x80\\x99s models, showing higher faithfulness, compression, and pass rates.â summarize api especially excels in tests that use real-world data, producing summaries with significantly lower levels of hallucinations and reasoning violations.â openai models were 2-4x more likely to produce summaries flagged by humans as â\\x80\\x9cvery badâ\\x80\\x9d, defined as completely unreliable summaries that contradict the source text or deviate from it substantially. even with extensive prompt engineering, openaiâ\\x80\\x99s results showed no significant improvements. some noteworthy stats: summarize api has an 18% higher pass rate than openaiâ\\x80\\x99s davinci-003, even when a detailed prompt was used. summarize api presents a 19% higher faithfulness score in comparison to openaiâ\\x80\\x99s davinci-003. summarize api achieved a 27% higher compression rate than gpt-3.5-turbo. summarize api has at least a 50% lower standard deviation of compression rate , meaning that summaries are consistent in their short length. takeaways ai21 labs' summarize api outperforms or on par with openai's llm results across a variety of models, datasets and prompt types.â the summarize api holds other advantages as well. as an off-the-shelf solution that does not require prompting, it can generate summaries with only the original text as input. this provides a better user experience and more consistency in results.â notably, human evaluation found openai summaries to contain higher rates of hallucinations, reasoning violations and incoherence â\\x80\\x93 common and costly limitations in llms that produce unacceptable results in real-world usage.â to learn more about the research and results, read the full whitepaper here.â about the author yuval belfer enjoyed this?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

       "  'text': 'summarizing legal documents for different personas using ai21 studio tutorial summarizing legal documents for different personas using ai21 studio create your own custom summarizer using ai21 studio\\'s large language models. this tutorial demonstrates the process on legal documents. weâ\\x80\\x99ve all experienced reading long, tedious, and boring pieces of text - financial reports, legal documents, or terms and conditions (though, who actually reads those terms and conditions to be honest?). imagine a company that employs hundreds of thousands of employees. in today\\'s information overload age, nearly 30% of the workday is spent dealing with documents. there\\'s no surprise here, given that some of these documents are long and convoluted on purpose (did you know that reading through all your privacy policies would take almost a quarter of a year ?). aside from inefficiency, workers may simply refrain from reading some documents (for example, only 16% of employees read their employment contracts entirely before signing !).â this is where ai-driven summarization tools can be helpful: instead of reading entire documents, which is tedious and time-consuming, users can (ideally) quickly extract relevant information from a text. with large language models, the development of those tools is easier than ever, and you can offer your users a summary that is specifically tailored to their preferences. let\\'s take legal documents, for example. though they are written in english, many people find legal documents to be difficult to comprehend, as if they were actually written in a foreign language. moreover, the interesting parts of each document may differ depending on the person who reads it, so off-the-shelf summarization tools may be too general or too specific. as an example, let\\'s look at the involved personas: lawyers . they are interested in several key points, but legal language and terms are especially relevant to them. your average joe. doesnâ\\x80\\x99t understand all the legal terms, and really wants to get the gist in simple words. using the irs as our example, we will demonstrate here how to build a simple summarizer for those 2 personas, and discuss which future directions one should consider. working with large language models large language models naturally follow patterns in input (prompt), and provide coherent completion that follows the same patterns. for that, we want to feed them with several examples in the input (\" few-shot prompt\" ), so they can follow through. the process of creating the correct prompt for your problem is called prompt engineering, and you can read more about it here . collecting data ideally, you should have a variety of examples to draw from. it is important that those examples represent the actual documents that your summarizer should work on. this means they should be written in the same way as real world documents, and they should be as varied as possible. don\\'t have it? no need to worry - large language models generalize exceptionally well, so the results will still be good. in the end, optimal results can always be achieved with proper data - but you can revisit this at a later date. summarize for lawyers if you are summarizing legal documents for lawyers, you should definitely maintain all legal terms from the original document. in this demonstration, we will work on the opening paragraphs of legal letters. here is an example of a few-shot prompt: you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary maintains formal terms. letter: dear [name], this letter responds to your authorized representativesâ\\x80\\x99 letter of may 19, 2022, and subsequent correspondence, requesting rulings regarding the income, estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer (gst) tax consequences of the proposed division of trust 1. the facts and representations submitted are as follows: grandparent died on date 1, leaving the residue of grandparentâ\\x80\\x99s probate estate in equal shares to trust 1 and trust 2, testamentary trusts established under will. trust 1 is held for the benefit of grandchild 1 and grandchild 1â\\x80\\x99s descendants, and trust 2 is held for the benefit of grandchild 2 and grandchild 2â\\x80\\x99s descendants. grandchild 1 has five children, great-grandchild 1, great-grandchild 2, great-grandchild 3, greatgrandchild 4, and great-grandchild 5. grandchild 2 has one child, great-grandchild 6. neither grandchild 1 nor grandchild 2 has any deceased children. trustees serve as trustees of trust 1. trust 1 is the subject of this ruling request. section 9(a) of trust 1 provides that trustees may distribute the net income of trust 1 to or for the benefit of grandchild 1 and grandchild 1â\\x80\\x99s descendants in such proportions and at such times as trustees determine is desirable or necessary, considering their needs, best interests, and other sources of income, or may annually accumulate and add all or part of the net income to the principal of trust 1. section 9(b) of trust 1 provides that trustees may distribute the principal of trust 1 to or for the benefit of grandchild 1 and grandchild 1â\\x80\\x99s descendants in such proportions plr-110419-22 3 and at such times as trustees determine is desirable or necessary for their medical care, comfortable maintenance, education, or general support and welfare, considering their other resources. section 9(c) of trust 1 provides that trust 1 will terminate 21 years after the death of the survivor of grandchild 1 and grandchild 2, and the principal of trust 1 will be distributed to grandchild 1â\\x80\\x99s descendants, per stirpes. if, however, grandchild 1 and grandchild 1â\\x80\\x99s descendants all die before that date, trust 1 will terminate early, and the principal of trust 1 will be distributed to trust 2. summary: - grandparent died

- section 9(a) of trust 1 provides that trustees may distribute the net income to grandchild 1 and grandchild 1\\'s descendants in any proportion they determine is desirable. - section 9(b) of trust 1 provides that trustees may distribute principal to grandchild 1 and grandchild 1\\'s descendants as they determine is desirable. - section 9(c) of trust 1 provides that if grandchild 1 and grandchild 1\\'s descendants all die before 21 years, trust 1 will terminate early. ## you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary maintains formal

additional five years under internal revenue code (â\\x80\\x9circâ\\x80\\x9d) section 4943(c)(7) for disposing of certain excess business holdings. taxpayer represents the facts as follows. facts taxpayer was incorporated as a state nonprofit corporation. taxpayer is exempt from federal income tax under irc section 501(a) as an organization described in irc section 501(c)(3) and is classified as a private foundation under irc section 509(a). taxpayer was created by individuals to support the domestic and international community and various charitable organizations. individuals were substantial contributors to taxpayer within the meaning of irc section 507(d)(2), and therefore disqualified persons with respect to taxpayer under irc section 4946(a)(1)(a). as a result of individualsâ\\x80\\x99 death, taxpayer received a shares of entity 1 common voting stock from trust, a disqualified person, on date 1, which taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. additionally, on date 2, granddaughter, who is the granddaughter of one of the individuals, and who serves as a co-trustee of taxpayer, received a testamentary disposition from trust of b shares of entity 1 common voting stock. granddaughter is also a disqualified person under irc section 4946. the combined shares of taxpayer and granddaughter represent approximately c percent of entity 1â\\x80\\x99s outstanding capital stock and are a minority interest in entity 1. as a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the a shares, taxpayer has excess business holdings of entity 1 under irc section 4943(c)(1). on date 3, also as a result of individualsâ\\x80\\x99 death, taxpayer received from trust an approximate z percent membership interest in entity 2, an llc, which taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. as a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the llc membership interest, which is a minority interest, taxpayer has excess business holdings of entity 2 under irc section 4943(c)(1). summary: - a taxpayer requested an extension of five years under irc section 4943(c)(7) for disposing of certain excess business holdings. - a testamentary gift of stock to taxpayer and a testamentary disposition to granddaughter, both disqualified persons, resulted in taxpayer having excess business holdings of entity 1 under irc section 4943(c)(1). - on date 3, taxpayer received an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest of an llc membership interest, which is an excess business holding. ## you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary maintains formal terms. letter: dear [name], this letter responds to a letter dated march 15, 2022, submitted on behalf of s corporation target, purchaser, and shareholder (collectively, the \"parties\"), requesting an extension of time under â§301.9100-3 of the procedure and administration regulations to file an election. the parties are requesting an extension of time to file the election statement under â§1.336-2(h)(3)(iii) of the income tax regulations (the \"election statement\") with respect to purchaser\\'s acquisition of all the stock of s corporation target from shareholder on date 1. the material information submitted is summarized below. on date 1, purchaser acquired all the stock of s corporation target from shareholder (the \"stock disposition\"). it has been represented that the stock disposition qualified as a \"qualified stock disposition\" as defined in â§1.336-1(b)(6). the parties intended to make a section 336(e) election for the stock disposition but, for various reasons, a timely election was not fully made. subsequently, this request was submitted, under â§301.9100-3, for an extension of time to file the election statement. the parties each represented that they are not seeking to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related penalty has been or could be imposed under section 6662. regulations promulgated under section 336(e) permit certain sales, exchanges, or distributions of stock of a corporation to be treated as asset dispositions if: (1) the disposition is a \"qualified stock disposition\" as defined in â§1.336-1(b)(6); and (2) a section 336(e) election is made. summary: and the completion: - the parties requested an extension of time under â§301.9100-3 of the procedure and administration regulations to file an election. - the parties are requesting an extension of time to file the election statement with respect to purchaser\\'s acquisition of all the stock of s corporation target from shareholder on date 1. - the parties represented that they are not seeking to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related penalty has been or could be imposed under section 6662. ## notes it is wise to try several phrasings for your prompt. you can, for instance, keep it simple and direct by writing: summarize the following part of a legal letter while maintaining formal terms. letter: [letter] summary: alternatively, you can take a more elaborate approach, such as: you are legalai, an ai legal assistant that excels at summarizing legal documents. below you will find part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary maintains formal terms. letter: [letter] summary: as you can see, we are providing the model with several examples, separated by a stop sequence, which is easily spotted while reading the text. you can read more about stop sequences here . because this task requires high accuracy, we recommend working at a low temperature. it\\'s best to explore the range of 0.0-0.3, since temperature 0 does tend to produce short summaries. you can read more about temperature here . you can test several options for the prompt in our playground. there is a consistent structure to all the examples in the prompt. this few-shot prompt can be created using the following code (assuming you have the paragraphs and summaries): def make_single_example(letter, summary):\\n    example = \"you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary maintains formal terms.\\\\n\"\\n    example += \"letter:\\\\n\"\\n    example += letter\\n    example += \"\\\\n\"\\n    example += \"summary:\\\\n\"\\n    example += summary\\n    \\n    return example\\n\\n# this is the stop sequence\\nseparator = \"\\\\n##\\\\n\"\\n\\nfew_shot_prefix = separator.join(\\n    make_single_example(letter, summary) for letter, summary in zip(letters, summaries)\\n)\\n\\ndef make_few_shot_prompt(letter):\\n    \\n    return few_shot_prefix + separator + make_single_example(letter, \\'\\') # keep the summary empty and let the model complete summarize for the average joe despite the fact that there are over 1.3 million lawyers in the united states alone, most peopleâ\\xa0 (still) aren\\'t lawyers and have trouble understanding legal documents. in this case, we probably want the summary to be written in a simple, easy-to-understand manner. as this task involves both summarizing and simplifying texts, it is inherently more difficult. thus, we will probably need more \"shots\" in our few-shot prompt (in this case, we added another example to the prompt). here is an example of a few-shot prompt: you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary is short and written in simple words. letter: dear [name], this letter responds to your authorized representativesâ\\x80\\x99 letter of may 19, 2022, and subsequent correspondence, requesting rulings regarding the income, estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer (gst) tax consequences of the

distributed to trust 2. summary: the purpose of this letter is to describe a trust set up by a grandparent for the benefit of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren. the trustees may distribute money from the trust, but they must follow certain rules. after 21 years, the trust will end, and the remaining money will be distributed to the main beneficiary\\'s descendants. if all the descendants of the main beneficiary pass away before then, the remaining money will be transferred to another trust. ## you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize

organization described in irc section 501(c)(3) and is classified as a private foundation under irc section 509(a). taxpayer was created by individuals to support the domestic and international community and various charitable organizations. individuals were substantial contributors to taxpayer within the meaning of irc section 507(d)(2), and therefore disqualified persons with respect to taxpayer under irc section 4946(a)(1)(a). as a result of individualsâ\\x80\\x99 death, taxpayer received a shares of entity 1 common voting stock from trust, a disqualified person, on date 1, which taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. additionally, on date 2, granddaughter, who is the granddaughter of one of the individuals, and who serves as a co-trustee of taxpayer, received a testamentary disposition from trust of b shares of entity 1 common voting stock. granddaughter is also a disqualified person under irc section 4946. the combined shares of taxpayer and granddaughter represent approximately c percent of entity 1â\\x80\\x99s outstanding capital stock and are a minority interest in entity 1. as a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the a shares, taxpayer has excess business holdings of entity 1 under irc section 4943(c)(1). on date 3, also as a result of individualsâ\\x80\\x99 death, taxpayer received from trust an approximate z percent membership interest in entity 2, an llc, which taxpayer represents is an unusually large testamentary gift or bequest. as a result of the testamentary gift or bequest of the llc membership interest, which is a minority interest, taxpayer has excess business holdings of entity 2 under irc section 4943(c)(1). summary: a nonprofit organization asks for more time to sell extra stocks it received after the deaths of a few key contributors. nonprofit organizations have a limit on how many stocks they can keep, so they request an extension to get rid of them. ## you will now be presented with a part of a legal letter. read it and summarize it. make sure the summary is short and written in simple words. letter: dear [name], this letter responds to a letter dated march 15, 2022, submitted on behalf of s corporation target, purchaser, and shareholder (collectively, the \"parties\"), requesting an extension of time under â§301.9100-3 of the procedure and administration regulations to file an election. the parties are requesting an extension of time to file the election statement under â§1.336-2(h)(3)(iii) of the income tax regulations (the \"election statement\") with respect to purchaser\\'s acquisition of all the stock of s corporation target from shareholder on date 1. the material information submitted is summarized below. on date 1, purchaser acquired all the stock of s corporation target from shareholder (the \"stock disposition\"). it has been represented that the stock disposition qualified as a \"qualified stock disposition\" as defined in â§1.336-1(b)(6). the parties intended to make a section 336(e) election for the stock disposition but, for various reasons, a timely election was not fully made. subsequently, this request was submitted, under â§301.9100-3, for an extension of time to file the election statement. the parties each represented that they are not seeking to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related penalty has been or could be imposed under section 6662. regulations promulgated under section 336(e) permit certain sales, exchanges, or distributions of stock of a corporation to be treated as asset dispositions if: (1) the disposition is a \"qualified stock disposition\" as defined in â§1.336-1(b)(6); and (2) a section 336(e) election is made. summary: due to the difficulty of this task, this prompt is not sufficient. by adding another example (\"shot\"), however, we will get much better results. below you can see the completion: a corporation asks the government for more time to file a statement related to its financial performance for a specific tax year. the government has granted the request but may check the information provided by the company later.<br> ## notes: like in the previous case, you should try several phrasings for your prompt. you can test several options for the prompt in our playground . alternatively, you could have summarized for lawyers first, and then simplified the summary (using a different prompt). this method may, however, result in some information being lost. summary in this post, we explore the use-case of summarization. if you need a simple, off-the-shelf summarizer, be sure to check out our specialized summarization api . however, for more specific use-cases and customization, itâ\\x80\\x99s wise to get closer to the core with the help of large language models, as custom models that are tailored to your specific needs will always get you higher quality results. click here to learn more. about the author yuval belfer enjoyed

standing on the shoulders of giant language models try for yourself contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that\\'s it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it\\'s your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly. name * email * message * thank you!

shared core values, flexibility, and excellence tweet hunter was looking for ways to empower creators to write incredible content faster, by removing gruntwork from the equation. they wanted to create tools that help creators focus on the creative aspects instead of the mundane tasks like editing, collection and formatting. tweet hunter's product needs were perfectly aligned with ai21's mission: to help developers build ai-first writing experiences. switching from the legacy gpt-3, tweet hunter found this vision only in ai21.â â\\x80\\x9cwe couldâ\\x80\\x99ve switched back to gpt-3 but we stayed because of the flexibility that ai21 was providing with the fine tuning of models.â\\x80\\x9d says thibault. one of the bigger differentiator for tweet hunter was ai21â\\x80\\x99s willingness to create a customized pricing plan to sync with tweet hunterâ\\x80\\x99s usage and growth. tweet hunter saved significantly on customization costs because ai21â\\x80\\x99s pricing for custom fine-tuned model usage is the same as the foundation model usage. other llms (such as open aiâ\\x80\\x99s) offer customization at approximately six times the cost of their foundational models.â with these criteria coming together perfectly, tweet hunter set out to optimize the product to have an 8-figure exit.â the first challenge: generative ai for social mediaâ social media channels have strict specifications such as character limits, use of hashtags, and even tone of voice which makes effective generative ai in social media a challenging task, requiring intense experimentation and refinement.â initially, this was a challenge for tweet hunter since their primary product offering was designed for twitter.â ai21 offered a 3-click custom model training which tweet hunter effectively leveraged using their proprietary data to fine-tune a model for the exact capabilities they envisioned. ai21 were flexible with both their approach and features so tweet hunter could build a tool with multiple junctions for ai to assist. the second challenge: too many distinct use cases writing engaging tweets presents a multi-level challenge: start with a creative hook, keep it succinct, and build an engaging experience for threads.â this means your ai text generator must be adaptable to different use cases. also, each of these use cases need to integrate seamlessly while being mindful of the user experience.â â\\x80\\x9ctwitterâ\\x80\\x99s own user interface and algorithm is optimized for engagement and consumption, it's not optimized to inspire you. and thatâ\\x80\\x99s a problemâ\\x80\\x9d says thibault. ai21 anticipated diverse use cases and built their large language model to be flexible and adaptable from the onset. as a result, tweet hunter could fine tune the model in three clicks, iterate quickly and reach success.â the resulting model was built with three distinct capabilities and two sub-capabilitiesâ thread idea generator hook generator tweet writer sub-capabilities tweet extender (expands on the tweet youâ\\x80\\x99re already started writing) each of these features are presented in a fluid transition on the tweet hunter platform, which lead to over 5000 paying customers for the tool. the third challenge: unreliable data to train large language modelsâ tweet hunterâ\\x80\\x99s founders had tried every method under the sun to consolidate relevant data, from using freelancers to creating spreadsheets themselves.â not only was this exercise time intensive but it also produced inconsistent and unreliable results.â they were so disappointed after trying out multiple generative ai tools that they switched back to manual data collection. they were worried that poor quality examples would interfere with the very premise of tweet hunter: inspiration for great content.â enter ai21.â the studioâ\\x80\\x99s in-built functionality allowed tweet hunter to fine tune the model to learn from a diverse tweet database. ai21's generated suggestions became exponentially better as the system evolved, and tweet hunter's goal of helping creators write save-worthy tweets was achieved in a fraction of the time expected. ai21â\\x80\\x99s custom model and proactive engagement throughout the journey was exactly what tweet hunter needed in a partner.â â\\x80\\x9cwe deeply appreciate ai21â\\x80\\x99s level of involvement with our product and needs in the early days. we were able to evaluate the modelâ\\x80\\x99s quality before production and maintain high standards on the quality of tweets.â\\x80\\x9d says thibault.â what changed for tweet hunter after working with ai21? in the last two years, thibaultâ\\x80\\x99s personal account grew from 2,000 followers to 60,000 followers. with tweet hunter's scheduling feature and tweet generation tools powered by ai21â\\x80\\x99s language models, he (and other users) could tweet frequently and effectively.â tweet hunter scaled to 1m arr and an 8-figure exit in under a year.â â\\x80\\x9cthe content is very high quality. the tool works with diverse creators, varied niches, and complex topics. so most of the growth comes from the fact that our users are actually successful with the tool.â\\x80\\x9d says thibault .â the level of personalization possible with ai21 propelled tweet hunter to first place for multiple creators.â https://twitter.com/mvxlondon/status/1621192750900051971 â\\x80\\x9cpersonalized, highly viral tweet formats developed with ai21 helped busy users share valuable content. that was the win. our tool became 10 times faster with the ai integration.â\\x80\\x9d says thibault.â the road forward with lempireâ\\x80\\x99s acquisition of tweet hunter, the road forward is fast-paced and fascinating.â the team plans to introduce new features to the platform based on public feedback. ai21 is also set to be integrated with other products in lempireâ\\x80\\x99s toolkit: personalized cold emails, automated follow-ups, and engagement with leads across multiple channels. about the author enjoyed this?

t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

       "  'text': 'unleashing the power of ai in game development: how ubisoft scaled content production case study unleashing the power of ai in game development: how ubisoft scaled content production learn how ubisoft utilizes ai21 labs to automate tedious tasks and enhance their game creation process, all while maintaining their creative vision. about ubisoft this video game titan doesnâ\\x80\\x99t need an introduction. but for the uninitiated:â ubisoft is the creator of assassin\\'s creed, just dance, watch dogs, and multiple other incredibly well-crafted and popular video games. they were one of the first brands to invent rich, immersive, story-driven gaming worldsâ\\x80\\x94back in the early 1980s. the company was founded on the principles of embracing human creativity and grew to rapid popularity by the early 90s. always ahead of the curve, ubisoft built their first ai gaming lab 6 years ago.â the story the script writers\\' work at the company is the cornerstone of the complex artifact that is a narrative driven game.â\\xa0 they create diverse and interactive elements - from sequential in-game cinematics to procedurally generated crowd chatter. we talked to ben swanson, research scientist at ubisoft about the challenges they were facing and how a121 helped.â why ai21 labs? creator-friendly vision, ready-to-use models, and legal compliance.â ubisoft and ai21 labs share a common vision: create tools to automate tedious tasks so writers can focus on creative pursuits.â\\xa0â â\\x80\\x9cour writers do excellent work. we want to assist them with whatever tools and models that we can.â\\x80\\x9d says swanson. ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99s wordtune has a similar philosophy. this vision and passion for the possibilities of human-machine collaborative writing stood out to ubisoft in their search for a reliable large language model.â â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99ve been leading towards ai21 labs because weâ\\x80\\x99ve had positive internal reviews from team members whoâ\\x80\\x99ve worked with ai21 labs previously.â\\x80\\x9d also, ubisoft utilized ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99s vanilla model from the get-go. very often, with llms, companies need a lot of customization and fine-tuning, but ai21â\\x80\\x99s model was a perfect fit for ubisoftâ\\x80\\x99s data augmentation needs. the intuitive api made the integration even easier.â finally, ai21 went the extra mile by ironing out legal compliance issues that have been a point of contention in other llm partnerships. with a model-usage fit and shared values, ubisoft set out to enhance their game-creation process with ai21.â the first challenge: repetitive manual work for video game writers one of the many different tasks that goes into scriptwriting is writing bark trees which are standalone npc lines that require as many variations as possible (and allowed by the voiceover budget). each of these groups of variations can be seen as responses to a shared motivation. for example, if the motivation is hunger, the character might say â\\x80\\x9cletâ\\x80\\x99s order pizza.â\\x80\\x9dâ simply paraphrasing â\\x80\\x9cletâ\\x80\\x99s order pizzaâ\\x80\\x9d wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t work in this case.â â\\x80\\x9cthere\\'s only so much you can do with paraphrasing. you actually have to pivot through the motivation or start from the motivation.â\\x80\\x9d says ben. ubisoft saw the value ai21 brought to the game development process. instead of having to painstakingly brainstorm 5-10 different ways to express motivation (hunger, in this example), ubisoftâ\\x80\\x99s internal models could use ai21â\\x80\\x99s output as a launch pad.â â\\x80\\x9cit lets our writers hit the ground running. it\\'s an inspiration tool for them. it\\'s a way for them to overcome writerâ\\x80\\x99s block.â\\x80\\x9d says swanson.â the second challenge: need for data augmentation to create an engine for automatic paraphrasing, ubisoft had to use internal models. and to reliably use internal models, they needed fine tuning data (which didnâ\\x80\\x99t exist). if theyâ\\x80\\x99d tasked humans with creating this fine-tuning data, it would have taken an eternity. â\\x80\\x9cso we use ai21 to suggest data of the correct form. itâ\\x80\\x99s easier for writers to thumbs up and edit or thumbs down than to come up with novel and diverse training data themselves.â\\x80\\x9d says ben.â with ai21, ubisoft could generate thousands of inputs and hand-pick the best ones to edit using their fine tuning datasets. with this augmented data set, the outputs became more diverse, and distinctive.â ubisoft embeds the npc generator and other similar models theyâ\\x80\\x99ve trained into the writing tools for their scripters. the writers are shown pairwise comparisons of outputs so the models can get further trained through human feedback.â â\\x80\\x9cbefore ai21 we wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t do this manually â\\x80\\x94 we werenâ\\x80\\x99t doing it at all . it was that tedious. â\\x80\\x9c says swanson. â\\x80\\x9cwhat we unlocked by our partnership with ai21 is an unlimited fountain of training data of whatever precise format we require!â\\x80\\x9d the third challenge: rising costs of in-context learning (data augmentation) with an unlimited fountain of training data, the next challenge was that of escalating data augmentation costs.â most llm brands charge based on both input and output tokens. with a 30:1 input to output ratio, ubisoft successfully optimized their budget for game creation.â this created an obstacle: ubisoft wanted to fine-tune the outputs to the minutest detail so their writers would work on high-quality suggestions. this meant experimenting with multiple prompts which would cost them significantly more money.â ai21 customized their pricing model to aid ubisoft in their vision: top-notch ai-generated recommendations so writers have more inspiration (and lesser manual work). ai21 charged them only for output tokens.â â\\x80\\x9cai21\\'s pricing model at that time was the best for data augmentation.â\\x80\\x9d adds ben.â what changed for ubisoft after working with ai21? â\\x80\\x9cthe win here is rapid scaling. when it comes to writing a game, there\\'s a tremendous amount of tedious work. for example, there need to be 10-15 different ways for a townsperson to â\\x80\\x9cget out of hereâ\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x94 or itâ\\x80\\x99s going to sound repetitive. writers often talk about having an editing brain and a writing brain â\\x80\\x94 the writing brain requires you to conjure something from nothing. the editing brain is where you polish it. so if you can jump to the editing step, that\\'s huge.â â\\x80\\x9cthat\\'s the promise of ai21: quality data augmentation outputs\",says ben. the road forward over a third of our conversation with ubisoft was future-facing. because of both teams\\' synchronicity, capabilities, and common beliefs, there are dozens of use cases to be built. hereâ\\x80\\x99s what ubisoft is most excited about: building a statistical reference model for video games engineered from ai21 labsâ\\x80\\x99s generative ai capabilities: ubisoftâ\\x80\\x99s vision to design creator-inspired, immersive games helps them build worlds with rich history, depth of character, and dramatic storylines. ai21 labs plans to document these complex worlds to offer stats and facts to players on command.â â\\x80\\x9cthe nice thing about ai21â\\x80\\x99s setup (as opposed to the kind of llm usage in video games you often see these days where it\\'s basically just a chatbot) is that our setup leverages llms in a writer-in-the-loop scenario.â\\xa0 additionally, as it relies on data augmentation and fine tuning, it allows writers to compose their own i/o - keeping it as a tool for them rather than a lower-quality replacement.â\\x80\\x9d says ben.â at ai21, not only are we thrilled to bring ubisoftâ\\x80\\x99s vision for innovation to life, but we are thrilled about the opportunities for contributing to a creator-first world. about the author enjoyed this?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company\\'s database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella?

we spoke to ryan bowman, publishing and creative writing veteran and part of verbâ\\x80\\x99s small team of founders, to find out how ai21 studio was a key to such creative writing success. forging the way toward a new creative ai tool verb is a writing tool that helps make completing long-form narratives â\\x80\\x93 novels for now but later films, tv shows, even video games â\\x80\\x93 faster, easier, and more fun. it does so by assisting with all key stages of creation: brainstorming, writing, and editing. but all that wasnâ\\x80\\x99t plausible until they found the perfect language learning model (llm). letâ\\x80\\x99s dive in further. use case #1: brainstorming plot pointsâ as we saw in the new york times quote above, keeping an entire story straight inside your head can be a lot of work. as anyone whoâ\\x80\\x99s tried to write long-form anything knows, it can get messy, convoluted, jumbled, and sometimes, uninspiring.â â\\x80\\x9cthey say novel writing is a group activity done by yourself,â\\x80\\x9d ryan tells us. â\\x80\\x9cso one of verbâ\\x80\\x99s jobs is to be that other person, that brainstorm partner.â\\x80\\x9d thatâ\\x80\\x99s why they set out to create one of their most important â\\x80\\x93 and as it soon turned out, most popular â\\x80\\x93 functions inside of their app: brainstorming. this feature allows you to plan the novel scene by scene, chapter by chapter. that type of brainstorming could look like the following:â you write: â\\x80\\x9cben is sitting in his office and a woman appears next door.â\\x80\\x9d you click: â\\x80\\x9csuggest a plot pointâ\\x80\\x9d ai generates: â\\x80\\x9cthe woman pulls out a gun and chases him through the hallway.â\\x80\\x9d then, you can either: run with that idea in your scene and use it as the next plot point, or continue clicking the â\\x80\\x9cwhat happens nextâ\\x80\\x9d button to generate more ideas until you find one that sparks your imagination and helps you continue. an incredibly useful tool for writers, itâ\\x80\\x99s been something that keeps these authors coming back for more. â\\x80\\x9cone of the most amazing findings weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen,â\\x80\\x9d adds ryan, â\\x80\\x9cis that the more you use what makes verb special - ai features like plot planning, the more likely you are to come back and write.â\\x80\\x9dâ use case #2: writing literary language generative ai models are incredibly diverse, and capable of outputting new content, summaries, translations, answers to questions, and more. but one thing they havenâ\\x80\\x99t been able to do just yet is write literary works. thatâ\\x80\\x99s to say, these ai models can create â\\x80\\x93 but theyâ\\x80\\x99re not necessarily creative.â â\\x80\\x9cwe needed to build tools that are specific to the problems of a novelist. it couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be just about generating text,â\\x80\\x9d ryan explains, noting that verb knew the ai model they were to use must be able to generate discursive literary language.â â\\x80\\x9clanguage learning models (llm) are not natural storytellers,â\\x80\\x9d says ryan, going on to explain how much storytelling is a learned craft; something that must be practiced for years in order to call it a skill. â\\x80\\x9cthere is 2,000 years of literary and practical theory backing up the idea that telling stories is hard â\\x80\\x93 important and necessary but difficult.â\\x80\\x9d luckily, ryan and the team at verb found the literary solution they needed in ai21 studio. â\\x80\\x9cwhen generating texts for our users who are looking for more discursive, more literary, more discriminating language, ai21 turned out to have a good tone and feel,â\\x80\\x9d he says. use case #3: fine-tuning, iterations & customer supportâ one of the critical tasks of validating generative models is having criteria. to validate the reliability of this sort of generative ai effectively, you still need human involvement â\\x80\\x93 especially when creating something brand new to the market.â howâ\\x80\\x99d verb achieve this? verb built a platform that tests generative output amongst thousands of judgments across multiple writing professionals. these individuals look at different paragraphs of literary texts and decide which ones they like better, which ultimately helps verb build a gradient of quality.â â\\x80\\x9cwe keep trying and testing and building iterations on top,â\\x80\\x9d says ryan, noting that they are always adding options to see which ones humans prefer. â\\x80\\x9cas crazy as it sounds, we are in the process of teaching it literary theory.â\\x80\\x9dâ along the same lines, itâ\\x80\\x99s important to note that creating something so new to the market doesnâ\\x80\\x99t just call for multiple iterations but also gathers support from everyone involved. â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99re in a world of newness,â\\x80\\x9d ryan laments. â\\x80\\x9cthere is nothing like [verb] so weâ\\x80\\x99re not always sure what weâ\\x80\\x99re supposed to be doing â\\x80\\x93 it is freeing and slightly frightening at the same time.â\\x80\\x9d ryan and the team at verb knew they needed a company that could see in their vision â\\x80\\x93 which is when they turned to ai21 studio. â\\x80\\x9cwe found working with ai21 to be a breath of fresh air,â\\x80\\x9d says ryan, noting that it felt like a collaboration done with real human faces they can interact with for guidance, assistance, and ideas â\\x80\\x93 rather than a business-client relationship. the results: more authors finishing their novels, faster the self-publishing landscape of 2022 shows that indie writers are becoming the new norm. but ai has been an alleged threat to writers since its inception, leading many people to believe that writers wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t even want the help of an ai-enhanced tool to get them across the finish line.â so, of course, verb also has to ask themselves the question: are writers really interested in having a machine collaborator help them with their creative writing? â\\x80\\x9cour early data says that they are,â\\x80\\x9d says ryan, noting that since launching its alpha version using ai21 studio, verb has seen a dramatic uptake of this experimental tool.â not to mention, as we saw with the brainstorming feature, the more creative and collaborative the model, the more likely writers are to stick around the app. in fact, ryan confirms that there are a dozen or so authors (out of an intimate group of alpha users) who have done the hardest task â\\x80\\x93 actually finishing their book! â\\x80\\x93 stating that verb helped them do just that.â with verb, and the help of ai21 studio, it can be done. dare we say â\\x80\\x93 it can be done faster, easier, and with more fun. verb.ai & creative texts in the future verb launched its beta version in late december 2022 to a select number of users, and plans to use this custom model to expand into other narrative forms such as screenwriting and tv & film. with the pairing of new tools such as verb with custom models from ai21 studio, generative ai has evolved from just helping individuals generate text to something much more intertwined with the human love of storytelling; an ai tool that is not a threat to writers but actually a collaborator, a copy editor, a creative director, and even a confidante for inspired wordsmiths around the world. are you interested in building your own custom model with ai21 studio by your side?

in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish?

application in ai21 studio and grow it from prototype to production using custom jurassic-1 models introduction in this blogpost, we walk through a case study demonstrating how you can build production-grade language applications quickly and effortlessly using ai21 studio. we use a simple text classification use-case as our guiding example, but the same process can be applied to a wide variety of language tasks. we start by introducing the task and implementing a baseline solution using prompt engineering with jurassic-1. although prompt engineering is a quick and straightforward method for building a proof-of-concept, it has some key limitations, which we highlight in detail below. to address these limitations, we implement a better solution by training a custom model specifically for our example task. ai21 studioâ\\x80\\x99s custom models are tailored for optimal performance on a given task and can be economically scaled-up to serve production traffic. even more importantly, custom models are easy to set up and use! custom models in ai21 studio require remarkably little data for training ; most tasks can be addressed successfully by training a model on as few as 50-100 examples. this dramatically lowers the entry barrier for training a state-of-the-art language model of your own, to power your app with excellent quality results. your trained custom model is served in ai21 studio and it is immediately available for use, making integration in your application as easy as performing an api query. our example task: classifying news article topics as a guiding example throughout this blogpost, we will use a well known natural language processing (nlp) task: classifying the topics of news articles. specifically, we follow the ag news task formulation, where articles are classified based on their title and their summary into one of four categories: â\\x80\\x9cworldâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9csportsâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cbusinessâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cscience and technologyâ\\x80\\x9d. for example, consider the following sample of three examples from the ag news training set: examples of news article titles and summaries from the agâ\\xa0news training set, first introduced by zhang et al (2015) and available online here . the correct labels for examples 1-3 above are â\\x80\\x9cbusinessâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9csportsâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cworldâ\\x80\\x9d, respectively. prompt engineering solution jurassic-1 language models are trained to predict likely continuations for a piece of input text, called a â\\x80\\x9cpromptâ\\x80\\x9d. we will use this ability to our advantage, by feeding the model with manually crafted prompts that give rise to a specific behavior in the model output; in our case, weâ\\x80\\x99d like the model to output correct labels for articles. the practice of composing a suitable prompt for a specific task is commonly referred to as â\\x80\\x9cprompt engineeringâ\\x80\\x9d . a common and effective prompt engineering approach is to construct a prompt containing a sequence of correctly labeled examples, often called a â\\x80\\x9cfew-shot promptâ\\x80\\x9d . the goal of a few-shot prompt is to cause the model to latch on to the correct relation between inputs (for our task - title and summary) and outputs (topic label). we built a few-shot prompt for our use-case according to best practices, as described in detail in the appendix . we measured the accuracy of predictions on the ag news test set, while varying the number of examples in the prompt. the results are reported in the table below. note that as we increase the number of examples, the models tend to perform better. this is typically the case with few-shot prompts. using j1-jumbo, we reach a respectable accuracy of 86% for a 16-example prompt. ag news test set accuracy for jurassic-1 models using prompt engineering while varying the number of examples in the prompt. why go beyond prompt engineering? we were able to get impressive performance on our task with a very simple method and a tiny dataset of 16 examples (4 per class). this is excellent, but there are several reasons not to be content with our prompt engineering-based solution. first and most obvious, few-shot prompts can become rather long as the number of examples is increased. this means that on each new prediction the model must read and process the entire prompt, increasing the compute time and resulting in higher latency, energy consumption and cost per prediction. since adding examples to the prompt improves accuracy considerably, we are left with an inconvenient tradeoff between quality and cost, making it challenging to serve production-scale traffic with prompt engineering-based solutions. furthermore, language models have a maximum allowed input length. jurassic-1 models can handle up to 2048 tokens (or roughly 2300-2500 english words), counting both the prompt and the generated text. although impressive, this might not be enough in many cases. imagine if instead of using a short summary of an article, we wanted to use the full article body as the input to our topic classification task. in such a case it would be hard to fit more than 1 or 2 examples into the prompt, so we wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have even one example per topic (recall we want to distinguish between 4 topics). alternatively, had we needed to categorize article summaries into one of 100 potential topics, we would have had a similar problem. even if we make the most out of prompt engineering, we may require even better accuracy. suppose we wanted to break the 90% barrier; judging by our results so far, this might be a tall order for prompt engineering. finally, we note that custom models have safety advantages. since they are trained to perform a particular task, it is harder for a malicious user to abuse access to a custom model. we give an example of this in the appendix . in the next section we introduce custom models as a more precise, scalable and cost-effective alternative to prompt engineering, which allows us to overcome the limitations described above. custom model solution custom models are specialized versions of the general purpose models which we have been using so far, trained to deliver optimal results on a given task. by combining our powerful jurassic-1 language models with our special training techniques, ai21 studio allows you to train a capable model using only a small amount of data, and makes it very easy to query your model once itâ\\x80\\x99s trained. to train a custom model of your own, all you need to do is provide us with a small dataset of correctly solved examples, and we will do the rest. the quality of results you get from a custom model depends on the amount and the quality of training data you provide. as a starting point for most tasks, we recommend using 50-100 examples, since we find this is often enough to achieve great results. so, if you can get your hands on a few dozen examples, we recommend you try our custom models. even if you donâ\\x80\\x99t have data at all, we have a few tricks you can use - see the appendix for more details. to pick up where we left our topic classification case study, we trained custom models for ag news while varying the number of examples in the training set. the resulting accuracy on the ag news test set is shown in the table below. as you can see, with as few as 10 examples our custom modelâ\\x80\\x99s accuracy is comparable to j1-large with a few-shot prompt. we also see that adding more training examples results in better accuracy for our custom model, surpassing j1-jumboâ\\x80\\x99s few-shot performance with only 80 training examples. ag news test set accuracy for custom jurassic-1 models trained on datasets varying in size. custom models really start to shine when we take latency into consideration. feeding the general purpose j1-jumbo model with an engineered prompt consisting of 16 examples, we got an accuracy of 86%, and the typical processing time in this case is ~250 milliseconds. a custom model that matches or exceeds this accuracy only needs to process the summary and title of the individual example weâ\\x80\\x99re labeling; there is no need to include a lengthy prompt in every request, because the task-specific behavior is already baked into the model. as a consequence, our custom model can process a typical request in less than 50 milliseconds, offering a greater than 5x speedup compared to prompt engineering . appendix: engineering the prompt an easy way to start engineering a prompt is to feed the model with simple instructions for the required task, such as the following: to predict the label for a given article, we could input the text above followed by the article title, its summary, and a heading that prompts the model to output the correct label as a completion. the full prompt using this scheme follows below. we can replace the text highlighted in blue with the relevant title and summary for any inference example weâ\\x80\\x99d like to label and let the model generate a continuation after â\\x80\\x9cthe topic of this article is:â\\x80\\x9d. this is commonly referred to as a â\\x80\\x9czero-shot promptâ\\x80\\x9d , because the model is expected to correctly perform the task without feeding it any correctly solved example. using the prompt above, j1-large has an accuracy of 32% and j1-jumbo gets 56.9% on the ag news test set; although significantly better than a random guess accuracy, this leaves much to be desired. the zero-shot approach can be improved upon by adding a number of correctly labeled examples to the prompt itself, making it a â\\x80\\x9c few-shot promptâ\\x80\\x9d . jurassic-1 models recognize and imitate patterns in text, so including a few solved examples in the prompt helps reinforce the desired relation between inputs (title and summary) and outputs (topic label); this usually improves prediction accuracy. a few-shot prompt using the sample of three articles above is shown below. as in the zero-shot case, it will end with the inference example specified in the same uniform format, so the text highlighted in blue will be replaced with the appropriate content for the inference example. once weâ\\x80\\x99ve decided on a prompt format as above, we can simply make a longer prompt by adding more examples in the same format. there are some considerations we should keep in mind while doing this: keep the examples relatively balanced between the classes (i.e. the 4 possible topics), to avoid biasing the model towards the more common classes in the prompt. scramble the order of the examples to avoid the model latching on to the wrong pattern (e.g. â\\x80\\x9cbusinessâ\\x80\\x9d always comes after â\\x80\\x9cworldâ\\x80\\x9d in the examples). make sure thereâ\\x80\\x99s enough room for the example you actually want to predict. jurassic-1 models are restricted to 2048 tokens, which should include the prompt and the generated output (1-2 tokens in our case). we built a prompt corresponding to these guidelines. the resulting accuracy for varying prompt lengths is reported above. not surprisingly, the best results are achieved with j1-jumbo and the longest (16-example) prompt, reaching an accuracy 86% on the ag news test set. appendix: safety advantages of custom models ai21 labs is committed to promoting safety in our products. one potential safety risk is deliberate misuse by malicious users of your application, exploiting its access to jurassic-1 to generate text for their malicious purposes. adversaries may attempt to achieve this via â\\x80\\x9cprompt injectionâ\\x80\\x9d , where the end-userâ\\x80\\x99s input text is crafted to alter the normal behavior of the model. as we will now demonstrate, custom models are less susceptible to such attacks than general-purpose models, offering a significant safety advantage when deployed in production. consider a malicious user who has access to the news article topic classification system built on top of jurassic-1 and wishes to abuse it to extract toxic generations from the model. recall that an engineered prompt for topic classification ends with the following text: where <title> and <summary> are user inputs. a malicious user may attempt a prompt injection attack by providing the adversarial input â\\x80\\x9cthe topic of this article is:â\\x80\\x9d followed by some offensive text in place of a legitimate summary, hoping that the model will generate the offensive text or something related to it as the completion. since language models latch on to patterns, the malicious user may even repeat this input line a few times to increase their chances of success. for example, below the adversarial input is repeated 3 times: the figures below compare the performance of the solutions described in this blog post - prompt engineering versus custom models - when faced with an attack like this. we see that the outcome depends on the number of repetitions of the toxic text in the input. for prompt engineering, if the adversary introduces 2 or more repetitions of the toxic text, 50% of the model outputs are toxic, and 3 or more repetitions cause the model to exclusively generate toxic outputs. for custom models, it takes 4 or more repetitions for the adversary to successfully extract toxic generations from the model, and even then the probability of a toxic output is much lower than for prompt engineering. percentage of examples in the ag news test set for which a prompt injection attack successfully generates toxic outputs. left - prompt engineering-based solution with a 16-example prompt. right - custom model solution trained on 3200 examples. the horizontal axis shows the number of times the toxic text (shown above) was repeated in the adversarial input. greedy decoding (temperature=0) was used for generating from both models although using a custom model doesnâ\\x80\\x99t eliminate the risk entirely in this example, it does decrease it substantially, in a way that makes other safety mechanisms more effective. for example, to protect against prompt injection in a news topic classification system, it makes sense to limit the amount of text a user can input in the summary field. any safety measure creates a tradeoff between restricting usage and guaranteeing safety, which in this case is found in the maximum allowed input length: set the threshold too high and prompt injection attacks will be more likely to succeed; set the threshold too low and legitimate inputs will be blocked. using a custom model, which is less susceptible to prompt injection out of the box, makes the tradeoff easier and allows a developer to choose a higher threshold while guaranteeing the same level of safety. appendix: no data? no problem! jurassic-1 custom models offer excellent accuracy even when trained on a surprisingly small dataset. nevertheless, sometimes even a small annotated dataset is hard to come by. wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be nice to enjoy the benefits of custom models without collecting any labeled data? as we will now demonstrate in our topic classification case study, this is possible. first, we note two simple observations: a prompt engineering solution with 1-4 examples per class achieves reasonable accuracy. the model assigns a probability to the label it generates, which indicates its â\\x80\\x9cconfidenceâ\\x80\\x9d in the label. high-confidence labels are more likely to be correct predictions. relying on these two observations, we propose the following simple approach: collect many unlabeled input examples for topic classification. use a prompt engineering-based solution to automatically label them with j1-jumbo. filter the auto-labeled examples by confidence, resulting in a dataset of examples where the model assigns >85% probability to the labels it predicted. make sure the different classes are equally represented in the dataset.â train a custom model on the high-confidence auto-labeled dataset. the table below shows the test set accuracy of custom models trained using this approach. we varied the number of labeled examples in the few-shot prompt, and used it to auto-label 160 examples for training. with just 4 labeled examples (1 per class), we beat j1-jumboâ\\x80\\x99s accuracy with an engineered prompt containing 8 labeled examples. using 16 labeled examples (4 per class) to auto-label a 160-example dataset, we not only beat j1-jumbo but also match the performance of a custom model trained on 160 manually labeled examples (88.5%). ag news test set accuracy for custom jurassic-1 models trained on 160 auto-labeled examples, while varying the number of manually labeled examples in the few-shot prompt used for auto-labeling. accuracy of j1-jumbo with a few-shot prompt utilizing the same amount of labeled data is shown for comparison. about the author enjoyed this?

on the shoulders of giant language models try for yourself contact us for early access what is a mrkl system? in august 2021 we released jurassic-1, a 178b-parameter autoregressive language model. weâ\\x80\\x99re thankful for the reception it got â\\x80\\x93 over 10,000 developers signed up, and hundreds of commercial applications are in various stages of development. mega models such as jurassic-1, gpt-3 and others are indeed amazing, and open up exciting opportunities. but these models are also inherently limited. they canâ\\x80\\x99t access your company database, donâ\\x80\\x99t have access to current information (for example, latest covid numbers or dollar-euro exchange rate), canâ\\x80\\x99t reason (for example, their arithmetic capabilities donâ\\x80\\x99t come close to that of an hp calculator from the 1970s), and are prohibitively expensive to update. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x enjoys all the advantages of mega language models, with none of these disadvantages. hereâ\\x80\\x99s how it works. compositive multi-expert problem: the list of â\\x80\\x9cgreen energy companiesâ\\x80\\x9d is routed to wiki api, â\\x80\\x9clast monthâ\\x80\\x9d dates are extracted from the calendar and â\\x80\\x9cshare pricesâ\\x80\\x9d from the database. the â\\x80\\x9clargest increaseâ\\x80\\x9c is computed by the calculator and finally, the answer is formatted by the language model. there are of course many details and challenges in making all this work - training the discrete experts, smoothing the interface between them and the neural network, routing among the different modules, and more. to get a deeper sense for mrkl systems, how they fit in the technology landscape, and some of the technical challenges in implementing them, see our mrkl paper . for a deeper technical look at how to handle one of the implementation challenges, namely avoiding model explosion, see our paper on leveraging frozen mega lms. a further look at the advantages of jurassic-x even without diving into technical details, itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to get a sense for the advantages of jurassic-x. here are some of the capabilities it offers, and how these can be used for practical applications. reading and updating your databases in free language ai-assisted content generation on current affairs performing simple and complex math operations. decomposing multi-step problems access to continuously changing information (weather, currency exchange rates) transparency and trust reading and updating your database in free language language models are closed boxes which you can use, but not change. however, in many practical cases you would want to use the power of a language model to analyze information you possess - the supplies in your store, your companyâ\\x80\\x99s payroll, the grades in your school and more. jurassic-x can connect to your databases so that you can â\\x80\\x98talkâ\\x80\\x99 to your data to explore what you need- â\\xa0â\\x80\\x9cfind the cheapest shampoo that has a rosy smellâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cwhich computing stock increased the most in the last week?â\\x80\\x9d and more. furthermore, our system also enables joining several databases, and has the ability to update your database using free language (see figure below). jurassic-x enables you to plug in your company's database (inventories, salary sheets, etc.) and extract information using free language ai-assisted text generation on current affairs language models can generate text, yet can not be used to create text on current affairs, because their vast knowledge (historic dates, world leaders and more) represents the world as it was when they were trained. this is clearly (and somewhat embarrassingly) demonstrated when three of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s leading language models (including our own jurassic-1) still claim donald trump is the us president more than a year after joe biden was sworn into office. jurassic-x solves this problem by simply plugging into resources such as wikidata, providing it with continuous access to up-to-date knowledge. this opens up a new avenue for ai-assisted text generation on current affairs. who is the president of the united states? t0 donald trump gpt-3 donald trump jurassic-1 donald trump google joe biden jurassic-x joe biden is the 46th and current president jurassic-x can assist in text generation on up-to-date events by combining a powerful language model with access to wikidata performing math operations a 6 year old child learns math from rules, not only by memorizing examples. in contrast, language models are designed to learn from examples, and consequently are able to solve very basic math like 1-, 2-, and possibly 3- digit addition, but struggle with anything more complex. with increased training time, better data and larger models, the performance will improve, but will not reach the robustness of an hp calculator from the 1970s. jurassic-x takes a different approach and calls upon a calculator whenever a math problem is identified by the router. the problem can be phrased in natural language and is converted by the language model to the format required by the calculator (numbers and math operations). the computation is performed and the answer is converted back into free language. importantly (see example below) the process is made transparent to the user by revealing the computation performed, thus increasing the trust in the system. in contrast, language models provide answers which might seem reasonable, but are wrong, making them impractical to use. the company had 655400 shares which they divided equally among 94 employees. how many did each employee get? t0 94 employees. gpt-3 each employee got 7000 stocks jurassic-1 1.5 google (no answer provided) jurassic-x 6972.3 x= 655400/94 jurassic-x can answer non-trivial math operations which are phrased in natural language, made possible by the combination of a language model and a calculator compositionality solving simple questions might require multiple steps, for example - â\\x80\\x9cdo more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?â\\x80\\x9d requires answering: i. what is the population of tel-aviv? ii. what is the population of berlin? iii. which is larger? this is a highly non-trivial process for a language model, and language models fail to answer this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin? t0 berlin gpt-3 there are more people living in tel aviv than in berlin. jurassic-1 berlin and tel aviv are roughly the same size google (first hit is a comparison between tel aviv and berlin) jurassic-x more people live in berlin than in tel-aviv [â\\x80\\x98return population of tel avivâ\\x80\\x99; return population of berlinâ\\x80\\x99; return which is bigger between #1 and #2â\\x80\\x99] step 1: population of tel aviv. result - 451523. step 1: population of berlin. result - 3664088. step 3: which is bigger, â\\xa0#1 or #2. result - berlin. jurassic-x breaks down compositional questions, answers the basic sub-questions, and puts together the answer. importantly, this process is transparent to the user greatly increasing the trust in the system dynamic information (like weather and currency exchange rates) certain types of information change continuously - weather, currency exchange rates, share values and more. such information will never be captured by language models, yet can easily be handled by jurassic-x by integrating it with a reliable source of information. we performed a proof-of-concept on two such features - weather and currency exchange rates, and the design enables quick integration with more sources to solve your use-case. weather - a loosely phrased question about the weather elicits an answer from all language models, where language models always return the same answer, regardless of when the question was asked (funny, right?), while jurassic-x provides an answer based on the actual weather prediction. iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be in new-york in 3 days. should i pack my umbrella? t0 no gpt-3 yes, you should pack your umbrella. jurassic-1 yes, you should. the weather forecast is rain. google (links to weather websites) jurassic-x yes, you should pack your umbrella, because in new york in 3 days there will be broken clouds and the temperature will be -2 degrees. currency exchange rates change much faster than weather predictions, yet the jurassic-x concept - a language model connected to a reliable source of information - easily solves this problem as well. how much moroccan money will i get for 100 bucks? t0 125 dirhams gpt-3 100 moroccan dirhams is about 27$. jurassic-1 how much is 100 dollars in moroccan money? google 100 dirhams = 10.75 dollars jurassic-x 100 usd = 934.003 mad jurassic-x combines a language model with access to apis with continuously changing information. this is demonstrated for weather forecasts and currency exchange rates, and can easily be extended to other information sources transparency and trust transparency is a critical element that is lacking in language models, preventing a much wider adoption of these models. this lack of transparency is demonstrated by the answers to the question - â\\x80\\x9cwas clinton ever elected as president of the united states?â\\x80\\x9d. the answer, of course, depends on which clinton you have in mind, which is only made clear by jurassic-x that has a component for disambiguation. more examples of jurassic-xâ\\x80\\x99s transparency were demonstrated above - displaying the math operation performed to the user, and the answer to the simple sub-questions in the multi-step setting. was clinton ever elected president of the united states? t0 yes gpt-3 no, clinton was never elected as president of the united states. jurassic-1 no google clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential electionsâ\\x80¦ jurassic-x bill clinton was elected president. jurassic-x is designed to be more transparent by displaying which expert answered which part of the question, and by presenting the intermediate steps taken and not just the black-box response your turn that's it, you get the picture. the use cases above give you a sense for some things you could do with jurassic-x, but now it's your turn. a mrkl system such as jurassic-x is as flexible as your imagination. what do you want to accomplish? contact us for early access contact us below and we will get back to you shortly. name * email * message * thank you! your

       "  'text': 'ImageChat API Documentation | Chooch DOCUMENTATION ImageChat API Guide ImageChat overview ImageChat is Chooch’s latest cutting-edge model that provides more detailed insights into visual images with staggering accuracy. Our new ensemble model combines computer vision and large language models to provide you with the best possible results. ImageChat-3 has over 11 billion parameters and was trained on 400 million images. For more information on the release and an example use case, read our blog . ImageChat includes functionality such as: Easy to use image analysis and descriptive chat Customized model creation and prompting Model integration with ReadyNow models for additional accuracy and localization Model integration with custom models Hosted API usage and automated image analysis ImageChat can be tested and demonstrated via Chooch’s iOS and Android apps or online . ImageChat Examples With ImageChat you can upload an image and have a continuous discussion, allowing you to provide multiple prompts for further analysis. The example conversations below showcase expected usage of ImageChat. The Web interface is easy to use and fun to chat with. In addition, the API interface allows you to query an image and automate a prompt. ImageChat then returns the analyzed result in less than 0.2 seconds. Please note you will need a free account on the Chooch AI Vision Studio . If you don’t yet have one, please sign up here . In order to use the ImageChat API and ReadyNow/Customized model integration, you will also need an Enterprise account. Using ImageChat Web Interface ImageChat in the Web Interface allows for one line prompts to be provided to ImageChat at a time. ImageChat will respond rapidly in a familiar-style chat box. Custom Model interface in the Chooch AI Vision Studio Customers can integrate an Object Detector with ImageChat for better analysis on custom objects and higher accuracy with localization in the form of bounding boxes. Create integrated models in the Chooch AI Vision Studio as described in the section below . Hosted API Interface Customers can use the ImageChat API to access ImageChat or an integrated ImageChat/Object Detector model automatically from their systems. This feature is great for continuously analyzing camera feeds, iterating through saved images or videos, or integrating into an existing system. See usage of the ImageChat API. iOS and Android Applications Chooch’s iOS and Android applications are perfect for testing functionality with your phone’s camera or any saved photos. In addition, these apps are great for showcasing ImageChat functionality to your friend, colleague, or pet. Creating Custom Models with ImageChat You can add an object detector to ImageChat for additional accuracy and localization within a frame. ImageChat combined with an object detector allows for unparalleled accuracy in detections and analysis. In order to create your custom ImageChat model, navigate to the Chooch AI Vision Studio and login. Select Custom Models from the left side navigation bar. Make sure you are in the ImageChat tab and select Add ImageChat Model. Provide a name for your new model. (Optional) Select an Object Detector from the Chooch ReadyNow catalog or from your custom models. (Optional) Customize additional parameters of your object detection model such as padding, confidence, and non-max suppression. These are useful for additional fine tuning during model testing. If you did not select an object detector, these parameter options will not appear. Add a prompt (or multiple) to automate detection with your new ImageChat model. Make sure to follow the best practices described in Prompting ImageChat to ensure the highest accuracy analysis. Once you have created your custom ImageChat model, you can select your new model and begin testing. Select Test Model to upload one or more images for analysis. View your results and fine-tune as needed by selecting Edit Model to adjust any additional parameters. Prompting ImageChat and Best Practices Creating high-quality prompts for ImageChat is crucial to generate accurate results. Whether you are using the web interface or creating your own model integrated with an Object Detector, ensure your prompts are free of typos, grammar errors, and straight-forward to understand. For the best results we recommend using prompts that are full sentences and end in a question mark. Instead of: is there fire Try: Is there fire or smoke in this image? Instead of: do you see corrosion Try: Is there corrosion in this image? In addition, refrain from making run-on prompts that can be confusing to ImageChat, for instance: Is there fire or smoke or anything that might be dangerous in this image? Instead, try multiple specific prompts such as: Is there fire or smoke in this image? Is there dry brush in this image? As you test and prompt ImageChat you will find that high-quality prompts can positively impact the accuracy of the results. If you are not seeing the results you are expecting, try adjusting your prompts slightly and test again. For instance, you can add the keyword “possible” to your prompt to allow a more sensitive detection from ImageChat: Is there possible rust in this image? In addition, including the phrase in this image? can help ImageChat understand your prompt better. Instead of: Is there fire? Try: Is there fire in this image? If you have any questions on prompting or would like additional help from the Chooch Team, don’t hesitate to reach out at [email\\xa0protected] ImageChat API Our cutting-edge ensemble model combines computer vision and large language models to provide you with the best possible results. Both ImageChat and Custom ImageChat models are available via API access for automating prompting and analysis in your pipeline. ImageChat API Below are code examples of using the ImageChat API. The API includes additional parameters to fine-tune your API call and ensure the best analysis. ImageChat Parameters: model_id: The ID of the ImageChat-3 model used to generate the predictions. model_title: The title of the ImageChat-3 model used to generate the predictions. predictions: The predictions made on the input image, provided as a list. Each prediction includes a class title, score, prediction keywords, and coordinates. prompt: The prompt given to the model to generate the predictions. image_width: The width of the input image in pixels. image_height: The height of the input image in pixels. image_id: The ID of the input image. workflow_predict_objects_only: (Optional) When set to True, ImageChat will only look at the objects detected rather than the whole image. workflow_class_filter: (Optional) This will only include the classes you explicitly state in the results. workflow_padding: (Optional) Padding percentage will add extra space within the bounding box detections. workflow_conf_thresh: (Optional) This will adjust the confidence threshold of the object detector and only show objects above the set threshold. Accepts values between 0.01 – 1.0. workflow_nms_thresh: (Optional) This will adjust the non-max suppression threshold of the object detector. Non-max suppression removes possible duplicate bounding boxes if they overlap with other detections Accepts values between 0.01 – 1.0.

Each imaging system captures its own images or videos, and then sends them to a hosted inference engine running AI models. Using Chooch’s computer vision API, these two systems can establish a standard protocol for communication. The host machine then takes the input image or video, runs it through the model, and sends the results back to the requester within a fraction of a second.

API v1 General Recognition AI API The Chooch API is organized around REST. The API recognizes objects and concepts in videos and images from our pre-trained models. The API is compatible with livestreams and live tagging. Image Recognition API The image recognition API is a straightforward REST API conducting classification and object detection predictions on images. The image URL is passed as a field to the API and the API returns a JSON based response with relevant predictions.

ImageChat is Chooch’s latest cutting-edge model that analyzes images and provides more detailed insights into visual images with staggering accuracy in most use cases. An ensemble of LLM and computer vision AI models make it capable of recognizing over 40 million visual elements. It’s providing enterprises a revolutionary way to build computer vision models using text prompts. Detecting wildfires with ImageChat AI One of the first ImageChat deployments is in the detection of wildfires. As we are all aware, wildfires in California can cause significant damage and pose a serious threat to people and property. ImageChat is deployed on 1000 ground station video streams, providing unprecedented accuracy in smoke detection. ImageChat also generates language descriptions of images, providing organizations with additional information about the detected elements. For example, in the wildfire case, the model identifies the location of the smoke in the camera frame and a confidence value of the detection, discerning haze, fog and other related events from actual smoke. This information allows organizations to make certain every possible detection is being evaluated with very few false positives. When computer vision meets large language models Trained on over 11 billion parameters and 400 million images, ImageChat-1 is a dramatic step into the future, bridging the gap between language and visual information. This type of intelligence, where machines can comprehend visual data using language, is taking the computer vision category to a much higher level of sophistication. The ImageChat model is built on Chooch’s proprietary architecture, which uses a transformer-based neural network, pre-trained on vast amounts of visual and language data combined with object detectors to generate localized, highly accurate detection of the most subtle nuances in images for any enterprise use case. ImageChat can analyze images and frames of video by breaking them down into individual components, such as objects, people, and locations, providing detailed descriptions that can be queried with language prompts from a user or automatically via an API. ImageChat is the future of image-to-text generative AI ImageChat is a profound milestone – the intersection of computer vision and language. With its remarkable precision, this technology has the potential to transform how we interpret video streams and images and extract valuable insights from them. Chooch anticipates enterprises will soon build their own ImageChat models using their unique visual and language data on top of the foundational ImageChat model. It will be instrumental in safeguarding and disseminating critical enterprise information to all stakeholders, ensuring business continuity and growth.

       "  'text': 'How to Use AI Computer Vision for Wildfire Detection | Chooch Images of burning wildland areas across the world are now familiar sights in the media especially during the summer and fall. In the United States alone, there is an average of over 70,000 wildfires each year , but worse yet, studies have shown that the annual acreage burned is over 60% larger than decades ago . Wildfires are becoming more devastating over time, and federal, state, and local agencies are struggling to keep up. Due to the land management complexities across government agencies, understanding who will fund this specific kind of disaster response is an enormous challenge for legislators and emergency agencies. Often state reimbursement from federal funds for wildfire recovery. A 2021 study by the Brookings Institution estimated that $7 from the federal government went to disaster recovery for every dollar in fire preparedness spending. Any way you look at it, early wildfire \\xa0detection and responsiveness is the most prudent way to being minimizing the \\xa0i fiscal, environmental, and human expense toll. The National Institute of Building Sciences estimates that every dollar invested in wildfire mitigation saved $3 in post-disaster recovery costs . Investment in immediate response protocols and tools that leverage the latest technologies are foundational for early detection and of fires. We sit at a unique inflection point where computers are smaller and more powerful than ever. Cameras can see greater distances with higher resolution in less light. AI computer vision is far more advanced and quickly becoming mainstream thanks to tools like Chat-GPT. Use of this technology working alongside the men and women in fire protection is gaining wider adoption. The case for computer vision as an essential investment in wildland fire detection The subset of AI called computer vision is easily identifying objects, people, and activities in images derived from live video streams. Such intelligence can “see” images and understand their context by leveraging computing frameworks like deep neural networks and transformers. In the past, such technology has been less mobile. The electrical, processing, and networking power was insufficient to derive real value from computer vision algorithms in ultra dynamic, real-world settings. Today, these algorithms can be deployed from cameras on cell towers, unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones to provide always-on monitoring of wide expanses of remote geography. Computer vision AI platforms, like Chooch AI Vision , are optimized for remote deployments out-of-the-box and maintain highly accurate fire detection algorithms that can distinguish smoke from clouds, fog, and other atmospheric conditions. Today, computer vision for wildfire detection is no longer an interesting experiment. It’s a robust and reliable technology capable of running on existing cameras and hardware and accurately detecting wildfires across thousands of cameras. It’s being used right now on over 2,000 cameras in California . In less than a second, smoke is accurately identified across a vast plain of imagery with false positives numbering in the single digits out of thousands of images every minute. Now is the time to make computer vision a foundational capability in any wildfire mitigation strategy. Key components of a computer vision system for wildfire detection A computer vision system for wildfire detection typically consists of three main components: image acquisition and processing, feature extraction and pattern recognition, and machine learning algorithms. Let’s take a closer look at each of these components. Image acquisition and processing Image acquisition and processing \\xa0involves capturing images of the environment using cameras and then processing those images to extract relevant information. Cameras can be placed on towers, drones, or other platforms to capture images at regular intervals. Once the images are captured, they can be processed using image processing technology to enhance their quality and extract features that are relevant for wildfire detection. Feature extraction and pattern recognition Feature extraction and patter recognition involves using algorithms to extract specific features from images, such as color, texture, and shape. These features are then used to identify patterns that\\xa0 indicate a wildfire. For example, algorithms may be trained to recognize the shape of a smoke plume or the color of flames, which would indicate the presence of a fire. Machine learning algorithms for wildfire detection The third component of a computer vision system for wildfire detection involves machine learning algorithms. These algorithms use patterns identified in the image data to predict whether a wildfire is present or not. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on a large dataset of images that include both wildfire and non-wildfire images, enabling them to recognize patterns that are indicative of a wildfire and make more accurate predictions Real-world applications of computer vision in wildfire detection Computer vision has several real-world applications that can help detect wildfires. These include satellite imagery and remote sensing, drone-based monitoring systems, and ground-based camera networks. Satellite imagery and remote sensing Satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies can provide high-resolution imagery of vast areas, enabling authorities to monitor wildfires across a wider geography. Some satellite imagery providers can even detect wildfires in near real-time, allowing authorities to respond quickly before the situation escalates. Drone-based monitoring systems Drone-based monitoring systems allow for rapid deployment of cameras to areas where fires are likely to occur, reducing response times and improving situational awareness. Drones can also be equipped with thermal cameras that detect heat signatures, allowing them to identify fires that may not be visually visible from the air. Ground-based camera networks Ground-based camera networks can also be used for wildfire detection . These systems typically consist of a network of cameras placed at tactical locations. These cameras can capture high-resolution images at regular intervals and then transmit those images to a central processing system for analysis. Overcoming challenges of using computer vision for wildfire detection Using computer vision for wildfire detection is not a new idea, but there were several core challenges that previously plagued its application at scale. Fortunately, forward momentum in hardware and algorithmic design have made computer vision both a trustworthy and robust solution ready for the field. Image quality and resolution In the past, image quality and resolution of images used for wildfire detection have sometimes impacted the accuracy of AI systems . Because cameras are exposed to the elements, cracked lenses and variable lighting made it difficult to distinguish fire and smoke from clouds, haze, or fog. A key revolution that has solved for these variables is the popularization of “transformer” models or self-attention models. Such AI algorithms specialize in maintaining positional context in an image, so the placement of fire and smoke can today be reliably deciphered amongst other occlusions or objects. False positives and negatives False positives and negatives have been challenges in using computer vision for wildfire detection . False positives occur when the system detects a fire when no fire exists, while false negatives occur when the system fails to detect a real fire. Modern fire detection algorithms err on the side of caution and likely trigger more false positives than negatives. Because AI is only as good as its training data, it’s imperative to train AI with similar vantage points as the real-world applications. The latest AI models, such as ImageChat ™ by Chooch , use billions of parameters to fine-tune varieties of training data, ensuring that the models account for the maximum number of edge scenarios. Scalability and real-time processing Finally, scalability and real-time processing can be challenging for computer vision systems used for wildfire detection. The sheer volume of data generated by cameras can be overwhelming, requiring significant processing power and storage capacity. In addition, the system must be able to process the data quickly and in real-time, alerting authorities to the presence of a fire as quickly as possible, b ut today’s computers are more powerful than ever in history. Graphics processing units, or GPUs, are equipped with over 50 billion transistors. Simply, hardware is more mobile and can handle more logic than previously imagined. Also, new data management paradigms adopted by telecom providers with the roll-out of 5G communications has optimized the way only critical data is sent over a network making close-proximity processing a reality for standard hardware tools. Use case studies and success stories for AI in wildfire detection There are several examples of successful AI-powered wildfire detection systems which have been deployed today. For example, the Fire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System (FIRIS) uses real-time data from sensors and artificial intelligence algorithms to detect wildfires in California. The Rapid Wildfire Detection Using Satellite Data (RAPID) system uses satellite imagery and AI algorithms to detect wildfires in real-time. Other examples include the NASA Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) web-based tool and UC San Diego’s project for real-time fire detection, ALERTCalifornia . Collaborative efforts and partnerships Collaborative efforts between government agencies, research institutions, and private companies are essential for developing effective wildfire detection and prevention strategies. By sharing data and expertise, these groups work together to create comprehensive solutions that are tailored to specific regions and environments. By leveraging the power of AI, computer vision, and fire detection technologies, we can protect our communities and natural resources from the threat of wildfires. Chooch has been active in this space since 2019 and has state-of-the-art, ReadyNow ™ computer vision models trained to accurately identify smoke and fire in any wilderness image.

       "  'text': 'AI Vision Leader Chooch Launches ImageChat Model | Chooch News / Latest News AI Vision Leader, Chooch, Launches ImageChat TM ImageChat TM enables people to chat with photos and other images—and they’ll chat back. SAN MATEO, CA — April 6, 2023 — Chooch, a leading Vision AI firm, has unveiled ImageChat TM , an innovative solution that enables enterprise customers and strategic partners to generate hyper-detailed computer vision models using text prompts. Chooch is highly regarded for its robust AI Vision platform, which uses AI to detect and comprehend the most subtle details in photos, videos, and other images. Now ImageChat takes intelligent image recognition to an even more sophisticated level. With ImageChat, computers say what they see. Try ImageChat here . ImageChat-1 is trained on over 11 billion parameters and 400 million images, with the ability to recognize more than 40 million visual details. By leveraging both AI Vision and large language models, ImageChat significantly improves data reliability and accuracy, making it particularly useful for use cases that require object detection and detailed reasoning. It is not only capable of generating detailed captions and keywords within images and video streams, but it is also purpose-built so that users can “chat” with any image, deriving deeper insights, and obtaining valuable information from images and video streams, much of which may not be obvious to humans. People can type in questions about images, and the images “chat” back specific answers. With the vast amount of more reliable data generated by ImageChat, any enterprise, regardless of its size, can develop its own AI Vision supercomputer capable of instantly detecting, comprehending, and responding to what it sees with straightforward text messages. This is especially critical in danger moderation, anomaly detection, as well as inventory management. ImageChat is applicable for automated data entry and visual data processing applications especially in manufacturing, retail, smart cities, geospatial, healthcare, security, industrial, and media industries. “ImageChat revolutionizes computer vision AI by increasing the corpus of computer vision models fused with language models. The result is a foundational “supermodel” for AI Vision capable of detecting minute details in images and videos without the need to annotate new data, such as smoke, scratches, dents, weapons, danger, accidents, and more,” said Emrah Gultekin, the CEO and co-founder of Chooch. ImageChat simplifies real-time decision-making pertaining to images with sophisticated automation, high accuracy, and superior user experience. The solution is available in the Chooch AI Vision Studio , AppStore , and Google Play for enterprises and developers. Additionally, the API is available for general usage and integration. The new ImageChat solution is part of the Chooch AI Vision platform. Chooch’s end-to-end computer vision provides AI in an easy-to-install platform that automatically connects to local video feeds and begins performing computer vision tasks in minutes, on the Edge and in the Cloud or a combination of both.

       "  'text': 'Chooch Eyeing Future Public Listing | Chooch News / Latest News Chooch Eyeing Future Public Listing Chooch , a company that tracks objects and actions using artificial intelligence, could pursue a public listing “soon” or in a few years, said Michael Liou, vice president of strategy and growth. The San Mateo, California-based company declined to speculate on whether it would pursue a traditional listing, direct listing or a listing via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), saying that it was premature to comment due to the changing landscape of listing processes. Liou pointed to recent volatile IPOs including C3.ai [NYSE:AI], which surged and then crashed and Robinhood [NASDAQ:HOOD], which fell on its first day and then surged by more than 20%. Chooch has not been approached by a SPAC, Liou said, adding that the SPAC market is like “the wild west” and flooded with pre-acquisition SPACs. While some SPACs have been “quite successful,” investors in other blank-check companies are likely “really burning mad” with troubled targets like Nikola [NASDAQ:NKLA], whose former CEO was recently indicted on securities fraud charges. In addition to being a venture capitalist, Liou was an early investor in numerous companies that went public recently including Robinhood, Wish [NASDAQ:WISH] and Didi [NYSE:DIDI], he said. Chooch, founded in 2015, uses AI to track objects for industries including healthcare, defense and energy, the executive said. \\xa0To add capabilities, the companies “always” works with partners including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), systems integrators (SIs), and virtual memory systems (VMS) depending on use cases, he added. Its technology can be used in operating rooms or to detect warnings for energy sites that could fail, Liou said. Chooch’s customers operate on a partner ecosystem, he added. The company can create models in a matter of weeks instead of months like other companies, Liou said. During the interview, the executive created and demonstrated a data set of syringes that showed the computer identifying syringes within a mix of other objects. Chooch reaches markets in Europe through partners, such as its presence in the UK through Pendragon , a car reseller that uses Chooch’s technology to improve user uploaded car images, Liou said. The company has received frequent inbound interest from investors, partners and customers in past years from regions like Japan, Latin America and EMEA, he added. Liou anticipates that the company will begin considering expanding strategically once the company gets “some good momentum,” adding that its international push would rely on partnerships. In November 2020, Chooch raised a USD 20m Series A round led by Vickers Venture Partners with additional participation from Streamlined Ventures , 212, Alumni Ventures Group and Waterman Ventures . The cash from the Series A round gives the company “years of runway” outside of the typical 12-18 months between raises, Liou said. The company hopes to improve its free cash flow with revenue from clients and eventually to be cash flow breakeven and essentially self-funded, he added. Although a capital raise isn’t Chooch’s highest priority right now, the company could decide to raise “a little bit more” capital at a higher valuation, the executive said, adding that he has received inbound interest from corporate venture capitalists who are interested in participating in a capital raise before a potential IPO. Broad competitors in the space include Clarifai , Matroid and Dori AI , the executive said. AnyVision , Deep North and C3.ai are niche competitors in the facial recognition, retail and manufacturing and utilities spaces, Liou added. #### For media inquiries, contact [email\\xa0protected] .

       "  'text': 'See How AI Transforming Shelf Management in Retail | Chooch You are probably aware of how more sophisticated data analytics is transforming the retail industry . Today across all customer touch points, artificial intelligence is driving the collection of massive amounts of data, and the latest advancements in computer vision technology are defining a modern approach to real-time store management. AI-powered computer vision is enabling retailers to monitor the most subtle images, or changes in images, in any video stream using their existing in-store cameras. Retailers can not only have this modern technology monitor security cameras, but also monitor stockouts, sending instant alerts to store managers when shelves are not properly stocked or could be better stocked based on shopper behavior. Re tailers rely heavily on data to deliver both consumer and supply chain data deriving insights never before available to them. They are prioritizing investment in AI for: Real-time data and insights: They are leveraging massive amounts of data from edge devices to help make real-time decisions and improve operations. Forecasting Changing Demand: Retailers are relying heavily on real-time data to anticipate shifts in demand for countless SKU’s as they improve point of purchase displays and cater to always evolving customer behavior. Personalization: Data at scale provides retailers with deeper customer insights to better improve everything from product placement to marketing personalization. Data sharing: Retailers are creating more transparency across their entire value chains, providing valuable insights to suppliers, distributors, and partners. The best part is that they reduce costs and improve service. Using AI for shelf and stockout management Poor shelf management and stockouts can dramatically reduce sales and have a direct impact on operational costs, employee productivity, and customer satisfaction. Most often, this is simply a result of poor visibility into store settings and shopping behavior. Computer vision is delivering meaningful benefits to retailers. It provides retailers with real-time visibility and insights into store settings, signage, and shelf displays. It delivers advanced monitoring and benchmarking of out-of-stock instances and product merchandising. AI-powered computer vision technology provides the infrastructure for more automated, real-time stock management, dramatically improving store operations. Measurable ROI of retail AI for shelf management How to address on-shelf availability with computer vision Foundational technologies such as barcode scanning, ID scanning, and optical character recognition (OCR) have paved the way for improving shelf-monitoring. These technologies, combined with data from live-streaming cameras, are used to power computer vision models that can detect anomalies in product placement on shelves in real-time with minimal human intervention. Building computer vision models to monitor stock out Creating computer vision models to deliver insights that retailers need requires a large dataset of images of each product SKU. For example, every bag of potato chips and every flavored variety, i.e., sour cream and onion, cheddar cheese, etc., requires unique images. This compilation of images builds the dataset that teaches the computer vision model what each bag of chips looks like and the subtleties between each so that it can understand what to look for on shelves and make predictions based on what it sees. Think of this as “teaching” computers what to see. How synthetic data is helping retailers Grocery stores frequently have 10,000+ items on a given shelf. This product volume makes gathering a large enough dataset of images to train the model incredibly tedious and time consuming. To speed up the process, rather than taking a photo of each product, synthetic data toolsets can be used today to generate images of each item based on their barcodes or UPCs. Manufactured, or “synthetic,” features like object occlusions, diverse backgrounds, lighting, rotations, noise, and blurring are proactively added to copies of images. This process creates a more robust and more accurate data set. It produces computer vision models that can see a much broader variety of product scenarios and are more effective at detecting specific objects or products. Using both real and synthetic data, the models can create a more robust analytical visualization of every product, on every shelf, in every location within the store for maximum visibility into shelf inventory. Now when stockouts occur, products are out of place, or misaligned, automated alerts can be sent to staff in real-time for them to investigate and restock quickly. Automating more of the visual inspection process reduces labor costs and placement errors. Fast responses to stockouts reduce lost sales while improving customer satisfaction and the overall shopping experience. Applications of AI for real-time shelf management Stock replenishment By collecting real-time data on inventory levels and stock movement, retailers can make faster and smarter decisions about how and when to restock shelves, reduce overstocking, and optimize pricing to maximize profit margin. Minimizing under-stocking and dead stock holding costs not only saves money but also streamlines operations and increases profitability. Planogram design AI-powered data and insights assist retailers with optimizing product placement by putting the most popular products in shelf positions based on shopper buying behavior. Computer vision finds patterns in data and aggregates it into heat maps, analyzing customer dwell times and store flow through. Contractual compliance Compliance audits can be time consuming for retailers. Pre-defined compliance metrics, such as on-shelf availability (OSA), share of shelf, and shelf positioning are all part of service level agreements (SLA) between retailers and suppliers . If retailers are found to be violating SLA’s by displaying too few products or by positioning products in the wrong shelf locations, contractual penalties and even contract terminations are possible. Delivering a frictionless shopping experience with AI Brick and mortar retailers continue to face customer acquisition challenges and increasing brand loyalty. Despite the continued growth of online shopping, nothing replaces the experience of walking into a store, browsing the shelves, and finding the product customers want to buy. Delivering a frictionless shopping experience is critical to keeping customers coming back, but low on-shelf availability (OSA) and a high number of out-of-stock events can impact that experience. Chances are if the inventory isn’t available to the customer to buy immediately, they have most likely ordered it from an online retailer before they have left the store. Traditional methods of managing OSA just do not compare to modern technology. Computer vision is changing how retailers are monitoring their shelf space. It provides the data retailers need to better manage product availability, shelf design, pricing, and product placements. Ultimately, It’s better enabling retailers to streamline operations, reduce costs, and deliver exceptional customer experiences.

       "  'text': 'The Value of Edge AI | Technologies Advancing Edge AI Adoption For the first time in history, our society sits at the convergence of high-powered compute devices capable of running the world’s most advanced AI algorithms in disconnected or environmentally rugged environments. This paradigm shift in computing is referred to as Edge AI, and it’s unlocking a myriad of insights across industries such as manufacturing , retail, and telecom because it unlocks streams of data closest to the point of inception. Much like the cloud computing revolution of the last decade that paved the way to “big data” related problems and innovations, edge computing is becoming the gateway to intelligent processing for side-by-side collaboration with end users. Understanding the types of edge AI What is edge AI? Edge AI refers to the use of artificial intelligence algorithms on devices located close to the source of data generation. This is a contrast to traditional AI, performed in a centralized location, such as cloud servers. By processing data locally, edge AI reduces the amount of data needed to be transferred for processing, making it faster and more efficient. In locations where internet bandwidth is limited – remote areas or mobile networks – there is a growing need for devices to be able to process data quickly and efficiently without relying on a cloud server. What is drone AI? Drone AI is the use of artificial intelligence algorithms to control unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones. Drones are equipped with cameras and sensors that allow them to capture data about their surrounding environment, which is then processed by AI algorithms to make better informed decisions about the best course of action. The benefit of using drones is that data can be collected from areas that are difficult or dangerous for humans to access, for example, inspecting oil rigs, monitoring wildlife, and even delivering medical supplies to remote areas. What is edge computer vision? Edge computer vision refers to applying AI to video streams for real-time inference of operational and business intelligence pushed from core compute services to low-resource edge hardware. There are numerous computer vision techniques running at the edge, including image, action, and pattern recognition; object counting and classification; and facial recognition . In all cases, these computer vision techniques run embedded within a non-IT asset, such as a device endpoint (like a smart camera), a gateway device, or on a local edge server. As data is fed from devices into these models, they continue to learn and can adapt to changing conditions. By automatically analyzing vast amounts of data, computer vision algorithms can identify patterns and trends that might not be apparent to human analysts. In identifying these anomalies, most analytics are performed on the edge, and real-time alerts are generated to initiate further action. Using edge AI for security With security risks becoming more sophisticated and, in some cases, catastrophic, security measures today are evolving beyond simple alarms, guards, and surveillance cameras. Technology is advancing common security systems and edge devices to be more sophisticated, utilizing advanced sensors, facial recognition technology, and computer vision. Computer vision models run on edge devices are trained on the data collected to identify different types of security threats, including crowds, loitering, weapons, and vehicles. For example, video footage can be analyzed for a crime as it happens; however, you may not be able to identify the perpetrator if they’re wearing a mask or if they’re not facing the camera directly. Combining computer vision models and facial recognition , multiple data points can be analyzed, such as the shape of a person’s face, the distance between their eyes, and the contours of their features, to identify individuals with a high degree of accuracy. This can all be done real-time with the advancements with running these models at the edge. Technology that’s advancing the adoption of edge AI Enterprises adopting edge AI paradigms have introduced a new set of technological needs that third party vendors or in-house operations must develop to stay at the forefront of edge intelligence.\\xa0 IT leaders will find themselves in an uphill battle of uncategorized data, which results in poorly performing AI models , data drift, and power and compute capacity constraints without considering the technologies below: Model compression Model compression enables larger, complex algorithms to be deployed in smaller, resource-constrained devices through several different methods such as pruning (weights and filters), quantization, knowledge distillation, and low-rank factorization techniques. Federated learning as a decentralized environment Decentralized deep learning methodologies, such as federated learning, enhance privacy and data security by leveraging data processing across client’s local networks without exposing training data. This means the data stays on the device and can be encrypted and secured more easily. Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies Networks of connected devices generate unstructured data in vast quantities. This is driving the demand for smart, contract-enabled protocols to protect privacy and authenticity of source data inputs to edge AI algorithms . AI chips and neuromorphic devices being integrated into edge hardware Smaller, more focused AI processors are being installed in CCTV cameras to perform a handful of common AI functions such as people counting, path flow analysis, loitering, and PPE detection; the breadth of these detections increases as more pre-trained AI models and services are offered by third parties. Enabling AI everywhere Organizational demand for actionable insights to improve business operations is driving the adoption of using edge AI. Real-time data processing, data security, and reduced latency delivers new value from proximal data. Cameras, drones, phones, and more are becoming compute environments for providing the data and analysis businesses need to grow.

       "  'text': 'Meet Chooch UX Designer — Zeynep Inal Caculi | Chooch So, what exactly is UX design also known as User Experience Design? The goal of UX design is to create a web application that is both effective and easy to use. To achieve this, UX designers must consider the business problems of their users, possess a high degree of empathy, and be willing to rapidly adjust features upon in-field testing and feedback solicitation. As Chooch’s Product Design Lead, Zeynep drives the overall design and functionality of new features that impact Chooch users. She brings a diverse professional background of management consulting, marketing, and product management across energy and telecom industries into cross-industry computer vision applications. Her mission is to delight Chooch users as they build, host, and deploy their enterprise computer vision solutions. How did you first become interested in UX Design as a profession? After working in the fields of consulting and marketing for many years, I knew that I needed a change, but I didn’t know how to pivot. After some research, I became interested in UX design, but I had a tough time figuring out how to gain practical skills in the field. At the same time, I was also working in the marketing department of a telecommunications company when I found Smartup Network , a software company that helps entrepreneurs and innovative enterprises build mobile and web products. I started working as a Junior Product Manager in the evenings and weekends. I wanted to see if the role was a good fit and realized I really enjoyed developing a tech product, especially the user-facing parts of it. Because I loved the experience so much, I left my current job and started working as a UX designer at Fol Agency specializing in UX/UI. What do you like most about your job? What I like most is the part of my job that involves anticipating human behavior and psychology. Additionally, I love creating a product that serves people’s needs and seeing it being used is extremely satisfying. The opportunity to be able to constantly improve the product and do better through feedback is also something I like. What do you keep in mind as you create an AI product for users across different industries? Designing products for the Chooch platform is very enjoyable for someone who loves challenges, and I’m one of those people. The reason designing any software product is so difficult is that it requires us to address so many different industry needs using one product and maintaining a cohesive user journey while doing that. For Chooch, it is so important we maintain a seamless journey between the Chooch AI Vision Studio, Inference Engine, Smart Analytics, and ImageChat . We are trying to bring together different industries into a common language and make the product more customizable and adaptable. How do you establish user empathy for a platform like Chooch? Our approach to establishing user empathy is to first understand business needs, emotions, and perspectives. We do this by using known methods, which include conducting user research, analyzing user data, continuously testing our product, gathering feedback, and making improvements. One of the most important things we focus on when designing products is to constantly iterate. We all believe that we can improve our designs based on user feedback, which is why we continuously strive to improve. Of course, for platforms like ours, our users include both our partners and their users, our direct customers, and developers, so we must cater to a wide range of primary and secondary personas. What is your main hope for the users of Chooch to understand about the product? My main hope for Chooch users is that they can easily leverage our platform’s powerful AI technology stack to solve their most complex business problems, thus making their work easier, more efficient, and providing them a significant competitive advantage. How has Chooch’s product design changed since you started? Where do you see it going forward? Chooch’s product design has changed a lot and has also improved since I started. We have designed new products from scratch, such as Smart Analytics and ImageChat , and redesigned our existing products based on user experience analysis. Of course, during this time, our logo and colors have also changed, making our updates even more noticeable. As Chooch continues to grow and innovate, I see our product design becoming more user-centric, with an even greater emphasis on simplicity and ease of use despite the perceived complexities of emerging technology. How do you effectively come to product design decisions in a fast-paced AI startup? If you’re doing product design in a fast-paced AI startup, you can’t follow all of the steps of a traditional design methodology for each feature; we simply don’t have the luxury of time. However, I still believe that it is important to at least touch each step in a structured design methodology, even if it’s less detailed. For example, sometimes we can’t complete a detailed conceptual design, so we still meet as a UX and UI team to draw rough sketches in brainstorming sessions. The most important thing is to decide why the desired feature is needed and which user needs it satisfies, and then figure out how all the products will be affected, even if it’s just with pen and paper. When making product design decisions, it’s always important to think from the perspective of what the user needs first – what problem they’re facing then how we can solve it. As always, over time, what the user wants is proven by how they use our features, and we adjust accordingly. What feature that you’ve designed are you most proud of? I don’t have a single feature that I am most proud of; I am proud of our teams’ work creating a platform that users find easy to create AI solutions to solve their problems. At the end of the day, my job is to solve the user’s problem in the most straightforward, simple, and useful manner possible. Where do you see UX design moving towards in the next few years? In the next five years, I believe UX design will continue to evolve and become more focused on creating personalized and immersive experiences for users. Voice-based interfaces, augmented reality, virtual reality, and 3D interfaces will provide more engaging and interactive experiences. There’ll be a greater emphasis on personalization where users will be able to customize their experience based on their preferences and needs. I feel an exciting trend we’ll see much more of is ethical design , which involves designing interfaces that prioritize user privacy and safety. What impact will AI have on UX designer’s role in product development? AI technologies will help UX designers analyze and interpret user data to better understand user behavior and preferences. It will also help with prototyping, testing, and even generating general design solutions. However, AI will not replace UX designers as there will always be gaps in technology that require human intervention and creativity. Want to meet more of the Chooch team? Check out the blogs below.

       "  'text': 'What is Edge AI? | Edge Computing | Chooch Edge AI is the intersection of edge computing and artificial intelligence: an AI paradigm that performs as much computation as possible on “edge” devices that are physically located close to the source of the data. This is in contrast to traditional approaches that first upload the data to remote servers running in the cloud, where the computation is then performed. What are the benefits of edge AI over “traditional” Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing methods? The advantages of edge AI include: Greater privacy and security: If data privacy and security are a concern for your organization, edge AI may be the best fit. Data is stored and processed locally, instead of being sent to a third-party cloud computing provider. Improved latency: Since you don’t have to wait for results to come back from the cloud, edge computing has much lower latency. Lower costs: Edge computing saves you money on the costs of data traffic and cloud computing services. Once you purchase the edge device itself, your expenses are fairly low. Better reliability: Edge AI can continue to function even in the event of an outage that disrupts communications or cloud operations. Edge AI is especially useful for resource-intensive applications such as computer vision, which relies heavily on images and videos. There’s no need to pay the costs of sending this visual data to the cloud when you can analyze it yourself on an edge device . Recent technological advancements in CPUs and GPUs have made edge devices more powerful than ever before. This means that it’s easier than ever to run powerful AI models on the edge . What’s more, this trend is only expected to accelerate in the near future. According to the intelligence firm MarketsandMarkets, the global market value of edge AI will skyrocket from $590 million in 2020 to $1.8 billion in 2026 —a blistering annual growth rate of 21 percent.

       "  'text': 'Computer Vision and 5G Edge AI | Chooch 5G and edge computing are inextricably intertwined technologies: each one enables the other. Edge computing depends on fast speeds and low latency in order to transfer large quantities of data in near real time—exactly what 5G is good at providing. For its part, 5G needs applications such as edge computing in order to justify its rollout to wider coverage areas. 5G allows for more and more computing to be done at the edge where the users and devices are physically located, offering unprecedented connectivity and power. The rollout of new technology developments such as\\xa0edge computing\\xa0and the 5G wireless network standard has created waves of excitement and speculation across the entire industry. Even better news: 5G and edge computing can act as force multipliers for applications such as computer vision and AI . Edge devices, connected to the vast Internet of Things (IoT) via 5G, can collect, process, and analyze images and videos themselves, without having to send this data to the cloud for processing. 5G and Edge Computing for AI and Computer Vision Mobile industry organization GSMA, for example, predicts that by 2025, 5G connections will account for 20% of connections worldwide and 4% in North America. 5G is predicted to deliver speed improvements that are up to 10 times faster than the current 4G network—so it’s no wonder that users are rushing to adopt this latest innovation. Meanwhile, IT analyst firm Gartner projects that in 2022, half of enterprise data will be generated and processed on the edge, away from traditional data centers and cloud computing. The possibilities of computer vision at the edge, powered by 5G, are nearly limitless. Edge computing and 5G can significantly enhance and unlock the potential of computer vision and AI technologies . Here’s how the process typically works: an edge device captures visual data through a camera or other sensor, and then send s it to the device’s GPU (graphics processing unit). An AI model stored on the device then uses the GPU to rapidly analyze the contents of these images or videos, and can immediately send off the results using 5G technology. There are many different reasons you might prefer to run computer vision models on edge devices, rather than in the cloud: Since you don’t own the servers yourself, running AI models in the cloud is a recurring expense. On the other hand, edge devices allow you to make a single, relatively cheap capital investment that you then own and can operate as you please. As data volumes continue to rise, processing this data locally and independently can help deal with data bloat. Use cases such as self-driving cars depend on near-instantaneous, highly accurate insights, and can’t afford the latency of exchanging data with the cloud. Below are a few more computer vision use cases in which high speed and high accuracy are of the essence: Image recognition models can identify the objects and people in a given image, accurately choosing from hundreds or thousands of categories. For example, edge devices can examine surveillance videos at a construction site to ensure that all workers are wearing\\xa0PPE (personal protective equipment) . Facial authentication models can determine whether a given individual is authorized to access a restricted area, with very high accuracy, in just a fraction of a second. Event detection models analyze streams of visual data over time to detect a given event, such as smoke and fire detection or fall detection . In all of\\xa0these use cases and more, edge computing and 5G can help boost speeds and lower latency, delivering immediate value for local users. Case Study: Wind River 5G Edge AI Wind River is a leading technology firm that builds software for embedded systems and edge computing. The company recently partnered with NVIDIA—which builds powerful, compact edge devices like the\\xa0NVIDIA Jetson—to create a converged technology stack with multiple edge functions, including 5G, intelligent video analytics, and augmented and virtual reality. The company’s demo, which was showcased at NVIDIA’s GPU Technology Conference (GTC) 2021, was built together with Chooch and other technology partners. Chooch helped provide multiple containerized solutions for intelligent video analytics and computer vision, with use cases ranging from safety and surveillance to healthcare and manufacturing . Powered by NVIDIA’s GPUs, Wind River and Chooch could demonstrate the tremendous potential that edge computing , now enabled by 5G, can have for users of all industries. Want to learn more?

       "  'text': 'What is edge AI Platform | Chooch Researching AI solutions? Recent technology breakthroughs have made edge AI a go-to method fro implementing computer vision.\\xa0 Need evidence? Market intelligence firm IDC has predicted that the number of edge AI processor shipments will soar to 1.5 billion in 2023, with a five-year annual growth rate of 65 percent. But what is edge AI exactly, and how do edge AI platforms work? Keep reading for all the answers. What is Edge AI? What are Edge AI Platforms? To answer the question “ What is edge AI? ”, we first need to discuss the key concepts of IoT and edge computing: IoT (Internet of Things) is a massive network of interconnected devices that can communicate and exchange information via the Internet. These days, IoT systems can be found in everything from self-driving cars to the smart toaster in your kitchen that tells you today’s weather. Edge computing is the practice of performing computation closer to the “edge” of the IoT network. Rather than uploading data to a remote server in the cloud for processing, edge computing seeks to do as much of this processing locally as possible, helping to reduce latency and cut costs. Edge AI is therefore the combination of edge computing and artificial intelligence: running AI algorithms on a local hardware device, without having to exchange data with remote servers. One good example of an edge AI system is Apple’s iPhone facial recognition technology , which uses a model of the owner’s face to automatically unlock the device. According to Apple, this model remains on the iPhone at all times, and is never sent to the cloud. By restricting the computation to the user’s device, facial recognition can continue to work even when the phone has no signal. Note that Chooch AI has a facial authentication solution. An edge AI platform is a starter kit for rapidly prototyping and building systems that make use of edge AI. These platforms are generally purchased from third-party companies that have simplified the process of training, testing, deploying, and monitoring AI models. For example, the Chooch Edge AI inference engine can deploy up to 8 models and 8,000 classes on a single edge ai device. What Are the Benefits of Edge AI Platforms? Without an edge AI platform, businesses would have to build everything from scratch—from the hardware itself to the AI algorithms that run on that hardware. Using an edge AI platform lets you get up and running much more quickly, innovating and iterating at the bleeding edge. Edge AI platforms also offer a great deal of stability and dependability. By choosing a solid, reliable third-party provider of edge AI platforms, organizations can outsource concerns such as support and maintenance, focusing on the applications of edge AI rather than the technical details of implementing it. Thanks to their popularity, Edge AI platforms have been used across many different fields and industries, including: Healthcare AI : Edge AI systems have been successfully applied to multiple use cases in healthcare. For example, large DICOM images from MRIs and CT scans can be analyzed on a local machine, rather than incurring the cost of sending data to the cloud. Safety & Security AI: When time is of the essence, running facial recognition and image recognition systems on the edge can make all the difference. Businesses can use edge AI to enforce health and safety regulations in the workplace (e.g. detecting the absence of hard hats on a construction site). Retail AI : Edge AI offers a wide range of possibilities for retail stores: analyzing customer behavioral patterns during the “buyer’s journey,” identifying products that need to be restocked, discovering recent purchasing trends, and much more.

       "  'text': 'Loss Prevention | Retail AI Improvements with Edge AI | Chooch Retail shrinkage is a multi-billion-dollar sore fundamental problem in the retail industry. According to the National Retail Federation, in 2019, the inventory loss due to shoplifting, employee theft, or other errors and fraud reached\\xa0$61.7 billion in the United States alone. To overcome the issue, retailers have implemented various loss prevention strategies and techniques, from electronic article surveillance, reporting systems, surveillance cameras, and plenty of policies to control the shrink. Yet, they still fall victim to shrinkage, and most of these methods are reactive and tend to be inefficient, cost-wise. The growing volumes of data have led organizations to use available data more effectively by developing systems to report, analyze, and predict shrink accurately. Thus, embracing advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and edge AI devices . Why should you consider integrating Edge AI in your Retail activity? Retail shrinkage can drastically impact retailers’ profits and might even put them out of business as the risk gets high for businesses that already have low-profit margins. The higher it gets, the more it can impact organizations’ ability to pay their employees and their business-related expenses, which eventually leads to poor customer service and experience. Loss prevention drives higher profits and more business growth for the retail industry. It is a prime priority for retailers to increase their profits and decrease losses, and Retail AI Solutions are promising in retail loss prevention. These advanced technologies are using data patterns and insights to predict fraudulent activity in forms of shoplifting, internal theft, return fraud, vendor fraud, discount abuse, administrative errors, and so forth. Hence, providing a more proactive approach to reduce retail shrink and loss. Retailers are now shifting to AI-driven solutions that allow an extensive set of opportunities to improve the customer experience as well as enhancing retail security by preserving protection against fraudulent elements of inventory loss and delivering a more reliable shopping experience. Edge AI solutions such as video analytics can run instantly and effectively respond to events and actions occurring at the store. How does Edge AI prevent Retail Loss? There is a significant shift in how Edge AI approaches the loss prevention strategies from reactive to proactive, predictive prevention techniques. The process starts with collecting data from various sources, including security systems (camera, alarm records, etc.), video, payment data, store operation data, point of sales, crime data (local crime statistics), and supply chain data. The data serves as a fundamental feed to leverage techniques such as computer vision, deep learning, behavioral analytics, predictive analytics, pattern recognition, image processing & recognition, machine learning, and correlation. Integrating Edge AI in retail loss prevention offers a set of proactive actions to stop retail loss, increase KPIs to prevent inventory loss, discount abuse, pilferage, shoplifting, theft, and return fraud and reduce shrinkage. Moreover, it shifts the strategy from “Identifying a case” to “Preventing a case.” Retail Edge AI strategies’ examples: Video Analytics Systems Video analytics powered with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms allow retailers to overcome the limitations of traditional video surveillance systems. Artificial intelligence makes video searchable, and actionable enabling its users to proactively investigate the retail loss and pinpoint persons susceptible to committing the retail crimes, as well as offering real-time monitoring and alerts system for suspicious behavior. Smart shelves Smart shelves are using technology to connect to the items they hold to monitor and secure these areas. Smart shelves are configured to provide real-time alerts and trigger calls to action for any abnormal activity detected. Beyond the loss prevention benefits , smart shelves enable retailers to track merchandise in real-time, giving insight into when to restock. RFID tags RFID-enabled smart tags attached to goods communicate with an electronic reader to track products. These devices can be removed at the checkout; if they’re not removed, a security alarm is triggered when the customer tries to exit the store. Point of Sale Systems An automated point of sale, or POS, is ideal for mitigating employee temptations to steal and help implement reliable inventory practices. Traditional systems are managed by employees. Still, failure to scan items is one of the primary ways employee theft occurs. Moreover, by not scanning a product at the checkout, employees are also discrediting inventory visibility. How Can Chooch AI help the retail industry to thrive and stop losses? The future of retail loss prevention is AI-driven. When used accurately, artificial intelligence is able to limit retail loss and manage inventory to overcome shrinkage and impact the bottom line. Are you looking for a reliable partner to strengthen your shrinkage prevention strategy with AI? Chooch offers computer vision and generative AI solutions that empower retailers to optimize in-store operations using real-time image and video data. Our technology helps customers improve loss prevention, inventory management, merchandising, and customer experiences. See how Chooch works and schedule a demo.

       "  'text': 'Benefits of Using Computer Vision for Retail Theft Prevention Retail industry businesses face the constant threat of theft-related inventory shrinkage, but traditional retail theft prevention methods leave a lot to be desired. In fact, despite the best efforts of retailers, one study indicates that 33% of retail shrinkage is from shoplifting and 33.1% is from employee theft. Now, some retailers are adopting computer vision technology for retail loss prevention . By leveraging AI-enabled cameras and sophisticated computer vision algorithms, retailers are reducing theft-related inventory shrinkage like never before. The challenges of traditional retail theft control strategies It’s important for retailers to use traditional theft control strategies — like human security personnel, security tags, and POS software — but these strategies don’t prevent all instances of theft. In fact, shoplifting results in over $15 billion in U.S. retail losses each year, and this doesn’t account for the enormous costs of employee theft. Despite the use of common theft control strategies, retailers still face the following challenges: Stockrooms and supply rooms are vulnerable: It’s difficult for retailers to track what’s happening in restricted areas like stockrooms, offices, and breakrooms. Dishonest customers, sales employees, and cleaning staff sneak into these unattended areas and steal items without being noticed. Employees are often seasonal: Most retailers perform background security checks on new employees. However, numerous retail employees are temporary and seasonal, making it difficult to know which ones can be trusted not to steal. The dangers of “sweethearting”: Sweethearting happens when a cashier employee adds additional discounts or purposefully doesn’t scan or charge customers for items. Organized crime: Instances of organized shoplifting crimes are growing more common. In these instances, a number of shoplifters will into the store and overwhelm the staff by asking for help with different products. While staff members are engaged, the other shoplifters will steal items without being noticed. Backdoor theft and trash can theft: Employees may steal items by placing them in boxes and taking them out of the backdoor of stores. They could also throw the items they want to steal in the trash and recoup them at a later time. Leveraging computer vision to stop retail theft Computer vision systems for retail theft prevention use a network of AI-enabled cameras, machine learning models, and advanced analytics to detect instances of theft and immediately notify managers to investigate. These solutions operate throughout the day, never get distracted, and monitor all store areas simultaneously. They can run in the cloud for easy scalability or on edge servers for faster processing and maximum data security. Chooch\\xa0computer vision systems for retail loss prevention can provide the following features and more: Tracking product locations and customer behavior: Computer vision can detect when a customer is about to leave the store without paying for an item. These systems can also trigger alerts to security personnel when a product disappears into a customer’s pocket or bag. Tracking products and boxes in supply rooms: Computer vision can monitor and track the status and locations of boxes and products in supply rooms for better theft prevention and organization. Tracking for organized shoplifting: Visual AI can watch for the signs of an organized shoplifting attack by tracking the number of customers in a store and their behaviors at all times. Detection of known shoplifters and criminals: Visual AI can immediately detect the faces of known shoplifters and criminals as soon as they walk into a retail store. Access control for restricted areas: Facial detection can control access to restricted areas like supply rooms. These systems use facial recognition technology that ensures only authorized employees enter restricted areas. Better checkout security: Computer vision technology can monitor cash registers to ensure that human cashiers charge customers appropriately for all items. This technology can also detect when customers try to steal items at self-checkout stations. Backdoor alerts: AI Vision models can immediately notify managers whenever an employee walks out the backdoor with items or boxes. In addition to these advantages, Chooch AI Vision platform delivers solutions for analyzing customer behavior and demographics and tracking and monitoring shelf space for out-of-stock items.

       "  'text': 'Meet Korhan Polat, Machine Learning Engineer | Chooch Insights What exactly is machine learning. Broadly speaking, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that leverages data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn. \\xa0By feeding large amounts of “training” data, computers can learn to perform almost any given task, with or without human intervention. As machines are fed more data, its prediction accuracy gradually improves. In many ways, the process mimics how humans learn. So how does machine learning impact our lives? When you purchase nearly anything online, machine learning helps guide you to a specific item you’re looking for. Your credit card company uses machine learning to decide if the transaction is legitimate or fraudulent. Social media sites, like Instagram, use machine learning to suggest posts that align with your interests based on your browsing behavior, click patterns, the time you spend on certain posts. Machine learning enables retailers to put ads in front of you based on topics in which you’ve shown interest. Pretty much everything today is powered by some level of machine learning. ML is helping machines do tasks that would normally be done by humans. It is changing the way we live our lives. Machine Learning is one of the most exciting areas of technology for software engineers. Engineers create algorithms that make machine learning possible. It is a highly skilled role, on the forefront of innovation. Meet a Chooch Engineer: Korhan Polat, Machine Learning Engineer Korhan Polat joined Chooch in early 2022 as a machine learning engineer. Prior, he worked as an ML engineer at Anadolu Sigorta, one of the first commercial insurance companies in Turkey. He developed CNN models using PyTorch, for detection and segmentation of car damages from accident photos. He received both a BSc and MSc degrees in electrical and electronics Engineering from Bogazici University in Turkey. He specialized in machine learning, signal processing, and computer vision. Korhan focused his graduate studies on developing vision AI models for classification of brain tumor types from MRIs and unsupervised algorithms that automatically detect human sign language. Korhan, how did you first become interested in machine learning as a profession? I have always been interested in science and technology. I enjoyed math and sciences when I was a student. And I like observing nature. I’m good with numbers. So, the decision to go into machine learning development was easy for me. What do you like most about your job? My job can be described as “teaching machines how to see”. We train AI models that match human perception or often surpass it. However, in some cases, the obvious for the human eye can be very difficult to detect with standard AI models . That’s when we come up with creative solutions as a team. I really like these challenges the most because we’re forced to be creative, and it reinforces how lucky I am to be working with the amazing team of engineers at Chooch. What is there about AI gets you excited? Help mere mortals understand. AI is a field that has evolved rapidly and each month there’s an exciting new AI model that makes everyone even more excited. Moreover, AI research is an endless endeavor to equip machines with human-like reasoning and perception. So, in many ways, AI research teaches us about ourselves, how we derive our own perceptions. This gets me very excited.\\xa0 I feel like I understand more about human perception as I work with technology to behave more like humans. Where do you think AI is going ultimately? AI has made massive leaps in the last decade. Initially, the discriminative models were revolutionary and took the lead. Lately, we’re witnessing the rise of generative AI models that are getting the most attention right now. I predict that this trend will continue. Also, there will be even more discussions about AI ethics. As AI becomes more widely adopted in our everyday lives, we’ll face many issues with an AI bias and justification. Where do you think AI will have the most compelling impact? What really excites me is AI’s potential to have a positive impact in many areas, but one of the most promising is in healthcare. AI has the potential to help doctors and researchers diagnose diseases more quickly and accurately, develop new treatments, and improve patient outcomes. AI can also help improve access to healthcare in underserved communities and make healthcare more affordable and efficient. Give us a sense of where AI will be ten years from now. Recent trends in AI research include the development of explainable AI, which aims to make AI systems more transparent and understandable to humans. Another trend is the use of unsupervised learning, which allows AI systems to learn from data without being explicitly told what to look for. Finally, there is a growing interest in using AI for social good, such as developing AI systems to help with healthcare or environmental sustainability. What will AI engineers be doing 10 years from now. How will their jobs change? Recent trends in AI research include the development of explainable AI, which aims to make AI systems more transparent and understandable to humans. Unsupervised learning, which allows models to learn from data without being explicitly told what to look for, will surely evolve significantly over the next few years. Finally, there is a growing interest in using AI for social good, such as developing AI systems to help with healthcare , or environmental sustainability. It’s important to start shifting people’s mindsets that AI should not be feared and has real benefits in helping people and the environment. The concept of Artificial Intelligence is certainly not new. Most of us perhaps first became aware of AI with the evolution of spell check in documents and on websites. \\xa0But its power to impact daily lives has never been more powerful than it is right now. Often AI makes our work lives and personal lives easier and better without us even being aware that it’s AI making all the things we take for granted possible. The recent news about more modern, more highly evolved chat bots is providing a glimpse into future possibilities. And though no one has a crystal ball, it’s safe to say that AI will ultimately change our lives at least as much as the personal computer has. Even more fascinating is Chooch’s development of an AI solution that will allow people to be interactive with photos, videos and other images to learn more about what is in them. You can ask the images questions, and it will answer you back. This is going to take machine learning to an entirely new dimension. Check it out yourself.

       "  'text': 'PPE Detection with Computer Vision AI | Chooch Industrial and manufacturing are two of the most high-risk sectors for workers—but that doesn’t mean you can’t enact safeguards and protections for worker safety while on the job. By using AI to enforce compliance with all applicable environment, health, and safety (EHS) regulations, you’ll be much more likely to avoid accidents and the long-term complications they entail for both workers and their employers. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 2.8 million nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses in 2019 . This includes over 400,000 nonfatal injuries and illnesses in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 15 percent of all workplace accidents in private industry. Meanwhile, according to the National Safety Council, the construction sector experienced the most workplace deaths in 2019, making it arguably the “most dangerous industry.” Far too many injuries in industrial and manufacturing settings are preventable—and many of these are due to improper usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) . For industrial and manufacturing occupations, appropriate PPE may include: Hard hats, safety helmets, and other headwear. Safety headgear protects workers from head injuries such as impacts, falling and flying objects, and burns and electrical shocks. Safety glasses and other protective eyewear. Safety glasses protect workers from hazards such as debris and flying particles, heat, light, and radiation. Safety vests and other reflective apparel. Safety vests improve workers’ visibility, alerting other people to their presence and protecting them from accidental impacts from vehicles and heavy machinery. The benefits of enforcing proper industrial PPE usage include: Fewer workplace accidents. Wearing PPE reduces both the frequency and the severity of workplace accidents . Better company culture. Employees feel better working for a company that demonstrates it cares about worker safety. Fewer lost wages and productivity. Injured employees lose out on wages and may have to go on short- or long-term disability, while employers miss out on the employee’s productivity and expertise. Lower insurance premiums. Limiting the number of workplace accidents also helps employers avoid additional insurance costs. Decrease in litigation. Fewer workplace accidents means less stress and expenses associated with personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits. Detecting proper industrial PPE usage with computer vision Despite the benefits of wearing PPE, your managers and employees are only human—so how can you ensure that\\xa0your workers are actually using PPE properly at all times? The answer lies in AI and computer vision models that can analyze camera footage in a fraction of a second, detecting safety headgear, glasses, and vests (and sending alerts when they’re not detected).

       "  'text': 'Computer Vision AI Safety Technology to Detect Workplace Hazards Employee safety is a top priority for businesses across all industries. Workplace injuries , physical security breaches, chemical spills, and fires not only cost businesses significant amounts of money but can also tarnish business reputations. As these hazards continue to impact businesses, companies are looking to emerging technology to deliver innovative solutions to detect, alert, and prevent workplace hazards . One AI safety technology being adopted by more companies is computer vision which enables machines to interpret visual information faster than humans can and with greater accuracy. The use of computer vision is already common within many industries, but let’s dive deeper into how manufacturers are adopting computer vision and applying it to improve employee safety and explore real-world examples of its effectiveness. Common applications of computer vision AI for workplace safety Computer vision has the potential to revolutionize workplace safety by automating hazard detection and providing real-time alerts. Computer vision helps businesses quickly identify and address safety risks, preventing accidents and improving overall employee welfare. Employee safety hazards take many forms, depending on the industry and work environment. These are some of the more common examples where computer vision is used for early hazard detection. Computer vision AI safety applications include: AI can provide significant advantages for manufacturers when used for quality assurance, including: Monitoring hazardous conditions Extreme temperatures, gas leaks, chemical exposures, fire, and smoke can be detected at the earliest signs of leaks or spills to prevent catastrophic environmental incidents, which in the United States alone, happen once every two days costing $477M annually . Detecting emergency response Struck-by incidents, where workers are hit by moving objects or caught-in between accidents where individuals become trapped in machinery or equipment can be identified earlier. Enforcing zones around no-go area sand sending alerts to supervisors when people cross into such zones can provide early warning. Identifying unsafe employee behaviors or practices Slip and fall, firearm, and proper ergonomic detections can be detected using computer vision models installed on cameras and other edge devices. Detecting personal protective equipment (PPE) violations Hardhats, gloves, goggles, safety vests, harnesses are all required safety measures that ensure an organization’s compliance with regulatory agencies, computer vision models can monitor adherance automatically . Predictive maintenance and automated inspection Signs of wear, damage, or tampering with equipment or electrical hazards , such as exposed wiring or overloaded circuits, can be monitored automatically by static cameras or drones running defect detection AI and watching for damage in asset intensive industries. The importance of early hazard detection Identifying and addressing hazards early is crucial for preventing accidents and maintaining a safe work environment. Early detection enables timely intervention, enabling businesses to correct unsafe conditions or practices before they escalate into serious incidents. For example, if an employee is working on an elevated platform and computer vision models detect they’re not wearing a safety harness, an alert can be sent to the employee and their supervisor to address the issue before a serious fall occurs. Traditional methods of hazard detection and limitationsTraditional methods of hazard detection often rely on manual inspections, safety audits, and employee reporting. While these methods can be effective, they have several limitations: Prone to human oversight Inspections and audits can miss critical issues, especially when performed by individuals with limited safety expertise or those experiencing fatigue. Labor intensive Manual safety assessments can be labor-intensive, leaving less time for more productive tasks. Reactive rather than proactive Hazards are normally detected only after they’ve already caused damage or injury, making it difficult to prevent accidents. In contrast, computer vision technology can provide real-time hazard detection and alerts, allowing for immediate corrective action to be taken. This proactive approach can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and injuries in the workplace. For example, computer vision can detect when an employee is not wearing the proper personal protective equipment, such as a hard hat or safety glasses, and alert them to put it on before they start working. This can prevent injuries and ensure that employees are always following safety protocols. Real-world examples of computer vision in workplace safety Computer vision technology has already been successfully deployed to enhance safety in a variety of industries. Here are three case studies that demonstrate its effectiveness: Case Study 1: Manufacturing plant A manufacturing facility used computer vision to monitor worker compliance with PPE requirements. The system alerted supervisors in real-time of violations, allowing them to take immediate corrective action. Over time, PPE compliance rates improved, and workplace injuries decreased significantly. Case Study 2: Construction site On a construction site, computer vision cameras were installed to detect workers entering dangerous zones without proper authorization or training. When a breach was detected, a real-time alert was sent to site managers, who could intervene and be proactive in preventing an accident. Case Study 3: Warehouse Using computer vision, a warehouse can monitor forklift operations, identifying instances where drivers performed unsafe maneuvers or failed to wear seat belts. The data gathered was then used to target specific training needs and promote safer operation, reducing the incidence of accidents and property damage. Computer vision and AI safety technology is evolving Computer vision is becoming a powerful tool for detecting employee safety hazards earlier to prevent workplace accidents . By understanding the technology and implementing the right system, businesses can protect their employees and reap long-term benefits. By detecting hazards early and proactively addressing them, businesses create a safer and more productive work culture for their teams.

       "  'text': 'How Does Computer Vision Detect Unathorized Personnel? | Chooch Detecting unauthorized personnel is a crucial task for any business that needs to protect the safety of their employees and clients, or that stores valuable assets or data on-premises. Human security guards certainly have their uses, but they aren’t without faults, either: they aren’t available around the clock, they can only be present in a single location, and they’re vulnerable to human error (just like the rest of us). Computer vision can help improve safety and security in the home and workplace by detecting unauthorized individuals. What’s more, computer vision models can run 24/7, with accuracy rates that rival or even surpass your human security personnel. Depending on the situation and use case, you may be able to deploy computer vision in multiple ways to protect the security of your premises , people, and assets: Motion detection: In some cases, you may need to monitor remote or off-limits areas where no one should be present. A simple computer vision model for motion detection can help detect the presence of unauthorized individuals and send alerts to the appropriate authorities. Vehicle identification: If unauthorized personnel are using vehicles to enter restricted areas, you can use computer vision to automatically record the vehicle’s license plate and identify its brand, model, and color. Facial authentication: If only certain individuals should have access to a restricted area, you can use facial authentication to separate authorized from unauthorized personnel. Computer vision models for facial authentication have very high accuracy, run in a fraction of a second, and preserve user privacy by storing only mathematical hashes, rather than the images themselves. Of course, this is all assuming that you have a robust system of security cameras and surveillance equipment that you can use as input to the computer vision model. The good news is that you can now run computer vision models on edge devices that are physically located close to the data source itself, rather than having to upload images and video to the cloud. This enables you to get real-time results, keeping your business premises, people, and assets as secure as possible. Share Featured Articles Edge AI When is the Right Time to Deploy Edge Computing?

       "  'text': 'Edge AI | Video Analytics with Computer Vision | Chooch Safety and security\\xa0must be paramount for any business that wants to protect its employees, customers, and assets from potential issues and malicious actors. Yet with more cameras and sensors than ever before, how can organizations lower their risk by quickly and efficiently analyzing the flood of images and videos at their fingertips? The solution comes in the form of edge AI for security video analytics. Below, we’ll discuss computer vision and video analytics work together and why it’s important to perform these analyses on the edge. Computer Vision for Security Video Analytics Computer vision is a subfield of artificial intelligence with the goal of making computers “see” like humans do. The domain of computer vision includes object recognition, facial recognition, event detection, motion tracking, and much more. While computer vision has been widely adopted in dozens of fields and industries,\\xa0safety and security\\xa0is one of the top use cases for computer vision. Here at Chooch, we’ve helped many of our clients develop computer vision solutions for their safety and security AI needs. The list of examples includes: OSHA compliance and public safety: Workplaces such as offices, restaurants, and construction sites all have their own set of health and public safety regulations that employees and customers must comply with. For example, computer vision systems can help determine whether workers are wearing protective clothing, such as hard hats or masks. Authentication: Certain restricted areas need to remain accessible to employees while remaining off-limits to the general public.\\xa0Facial identification systems with liveness detection, supported by computer vision, can help distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate access requests. Remote sensing: Many security cameras and sensors are located in remote areas, making it even more important to detect potential issues and risks. Computer vision can help identify suspicious vehicles, record license plates, detect breaches of a boundary or perimeter, and much more. Object recognition: Using cameras and thermographic sensors for infrared radiation, you can more easily identify noteworthy objects and people within just a fraction of a second, rapidly determining if they pose a security risk. Security video analytics on the edge While computer vision has many possible applications, few of them are as time-sensitive as safety and security. When a computer vision system identifies a potential risk to your organization, you need to take swift and decisive action. This means, of course, that time is of the essence when performing security video analytics. Unfortunately, many computer vision systems are too slow to perform real-time analysis: instead of processing the captured images or video themselves, they upload this data to a more powerful machine in the cloud. Latency issues (waiting for data to be uploaded and analyzed) present a barrier to large-scale adoption of computer vision for safety and security AI . That’s why edge AI is an essential development for the field of security video analytics. Edge computing is a paradigm in which data processing occurs in “edge” devices that are physically located close to the original point of capture, rather than by servers in the cloud. While the field of edge AI is young, it’s growing rapidly as more and more businesses come to realize the\\xa0benefits of edge computing . For example, Accenture predicts that by 2025, 70 percent of security surveillance cameras will come equipped with real-time monitoring and analytics capabilities, versus just 5 percent in 2018. So how can you leverage the power of the edge for your own safety and security AI needs? Chooch has developed an\\xa0edge AI platform\\xa0that can deploy up to 8 models with 8,000 different classes on a single edge device, letting you identify thousands of different types of objects. Powered by NVIDIA Jetson devices, Chooch’s edge AI platform delivers results with greater than 90 percent accuracy within just a fraction of a second.

       "  'text': 'Why Facial Authentication Requires Liveness Detection | Chooch Facial authentication\\xa0is a great way to protect virtual content.But like all security features, it too has some dangerous loopholes. With enhanced camera features, 2D or 3D printers, or animation, it is very easy to create fake images that can pass for an actual face. These are what are known as presentation attacks. Preventing presentation attacks is where\\xa0liveness detection\\xa0comes in, and now it’s easier than ever to implement with the Facial Recognition API\\xa0from\\xa0Chooch . While facial recognition is a good tool for authentication, liveness detection algorithms take care of its vulnerabilities and make sure that these biometric modalities are not compromised in any way. Presentation Attacks Facial recognition , while being a very useful biometric modality, is susceptible to attacks and attempts by fraudsters to destroy its security measures. These attacks are known as presentation attacks or “spoofs”. To get past the biometric security measures and protection systems placed, a fraudster will provide a non-live image, false printed or digital photograph. Videos or masks are also used to impersonate a particular person and assume a fake identity. Presentation attacks are usually of two types and these types depend upon the kind of result the fraudster wishes to cultivate. False Match In a one-to-one biometric comparison, if the fraudster is successful, it is a false match as the fraudster has been able to avoid detection by providing a sample image of the targeted victim. Once this happens, the fraudster will be able to go through the victim’s account, having access to all the applications. False Non-Match If the fraudster creates one account or multiple new accounts of the victim by using an image that will not work in a biometric watch list (especially if the facial features are somehow masked) or duplicate search, it is a false non-match. These false non-matches are very difficult to identify and track as there are too many such accounts. To avoid these attacks, liveness detection is very important. In mobile onboarding, the risk of such attacks or attempts of fraudsters will remain, but this can be prevented if liveness detection algorithms are used. These algorithms can easily select false, non-live images, even if they cannot be used in biometric watch list searches. Liveness detection algorithms can be easily combined with multimodal biometrics, for example, voice recognition, and this strengthens the security measures . If these precautions are not taken, then facial recognition will not be secure from spoofs or presentation attacks. Different Techniques for Liveness Detection The primary job of liveness detection techniques is to provide the maximum security possible and to prevent fraudsters from taking advantage of the existing biometric modalities. Liveness detection techniques are not meant to compromise the user’s experience of using an application, in any way. The different techniques implemented try to minimize interaction with the user so that there are no interruptions that can affect the usage of the application. Active Liveness Detection As the name suggests, this form of liveness detection algorithm requires the user to be active in some. The user might need to wink, smile or shake his or her head. While this prompts a certain level of interaction, the advantage of active liveness detection is that the user will be completely aware during the process. Passive Liveness Detection The technique depends upon algorithms that can detect if any part of the image is false. These algorithms check discrepancies in the image, for example, masks, any kind of distortion, or different textures. Passive liveness detection happens in the background and as it is not even visible to the user, fraudsters find it difficult to get through. Hybrid A hybrid liveness detection technique, while not interacting with the user is not exactly opaque. Therefore, it can still be detected by fraudsters and evaded. How are Liveness Detection Products Certified Against Presentation Attacks? To certify a liveness detection product, its ability to perform is tested. These tests usually involve the use of spoofs to try and get across the biometric security measures. If the liveness detection product is successful in outing these spoofs, and if its performance is according to international standards, then the product is certified. However, these tests might have different settings that might change after production or the spoofed content used might not cover the range of attacks that the product may have to face. There are also some tests that are not of much use in mobile onboarding and the performance of the product in such cases becomes rather irrelevant. Now, if one tries hard enough, it is possible to overcome any security measures, even those of liveness detection. Therefore, before a liveness detection product is certified, it has to go through rigorous evaluation procedures. This will ensure that all possible vulnerabilities are covered. Facial Authentication\\xa0from\\xa0Chooch AI has been tested by partners and was found to be spoofproof with liveness detection.

       "  'text': 'How to Turn Unstructured Video Data into Structured Data | Chooch Analyzing big data is crucial for organizations to make smarter data-driven decisions—but not all big data is created equally. It’s important to make the distinction between structured data and unstructured data: Structured data is information that follows a highly organized, predefined schema, making it easy to search through and query. If it can fit inside a relational database or Excel spreadsheet with intersecting rows and columns, it’s structured data. Unstructured data is any information that doesn’t fall into the neat categories of structured data. Examples of unstructured data include text, images, and audio files. In particular, videos are a prime example of unstructured data. Rather than the digital bits and bytes that make up video files, what’s really of interest is high-level information about what the video contains and depicts—from using facial recognition on individuals who appear in the video to detecting dangerous events with fire detection and\\xa0fall detection. But how can you extract this information in an automated, efficient manner? In other words, how can you turn videos into structured data? How to Create Structured Data from Videos To create structured data from videos, organizations are using sophisticated computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques. Computer vision platforms like\\xa0Chooch\\xa0can help anyone build state-of-the-art\\xa0AI models\\xa0that analyze videos frame by frame, detecting the people, objects, or events that you’ve trained them to look for. Once you’ve gone through the\\xa0AI training\\xa0process, your computer vision model can automatically annotate each frame of the video. AI models can detect the motion of a person or object throughout the scene, as well as detect various actions and events. These annotations, which are saved as structured data, can then be searched and queried to retrieve the most relevant parts of the video. Use Cases of Computer Vision for Video Data Media AI: Computer vision has a wide range of applications in the media and entertainment industries. For example, you can automatically tag the objects in a livestream video, allowing for better targeted advertising. You can also perform facial recognition on the people (e.g., celebrities) in a video, making it easier for people to find who and what they’re looking for. Safety & Security AI : In the field of safety and security, computer vision can help protect public spaces from threats and dangers. Facial recognition models can confirm that an individual is authorized to access the premises, while PPE detection models can make sure that workers are wearing the appropriate clothing and equipment on the job. Geospatial AI: Computer vision models can efficiently analyze drone and satellite images and videos. For example, you can train an AI model to detect wildfires, analyze drought or industrial activity levels, identify different animal species, and much more. Conclusion It’s now easier than ever for your unstructured video data to become structured, thanks to computer vision and AI.

       "  'text': '5 Steps To Accelerating Computer Vision Adoption | Chooch The reasons for AI project failure are numerous, diverse, and complex. One of the biggest causes, however, is lacking the\\xa0necessary\\xa0technical skills—whether from in-house data scientists and machine learning engineers, or from a strong third-party computer vision consulting partner. AI Success With Computer Vision Consulting Despite the enormous potential of state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning technologies, many businesses are still struggling to fulfill their expectations. According to a 2019 report by Pactera Technologies, 85 percent of AI projects ultimately fail . Another report from Dimensional Research found that nearly 8 out of 10 organizations using AI and machine learning say that their projects in these domains have stalled. So, with these statistics in mind, how can you beat the odds and make your own computer vision project a success, without having to get a triple degree in the fields of computer science, computer engineering, and image processing? While it’s never a guarantee, there are a number of actions you can take to dramatically improve the likelihood that users will adopt your computer vision solution . Below, we’ll go over 5 steps to accelerate adoption, based on our years of computer vision consulting expertise. Computer Vision Consulting Step 1: Understand the Potential The first step is to understand the potential that computer vision, AI, and big data can bring to your organization: for example,\\xa0using computer vision for real time analysis of medical imaging,\\xa0or for improving the quality of computer graphics. This means a careful and considerate assessment of your existing processes, workflows, and pain points. From there, you can highlight a few key priorities that you plan to focus on. Doing your research and finding a case study for companies in a similar position and industry can help you set your expectations for the project appropriately. According to the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, companies that focus on a few clearly defined themes and priorities during digital transformations are 1.7 times more likely to have the project exceed their expectations . Understand how your chosen initiative will impact your broader business strategy—for example, how it can help you obtain a competitive advantage, or improve your customer experience. Getting all hands on deck and everyone in agreement—from key decision-makers like managers and executives, to the workers in the trenches—is crucial to ensure the project’s success. Computer Vision Consulting Step 2: Plan a Deployment From there, your next step is to plan and execute the roadmap you’ve created for the project.\\xa0Having the right mix of people and skills is an essential qualification—but unfortunately, one that too many businesses aren’t able to meet. According to research by Boston Consulting Group, only 1 in 4 organizations have access to the talent they need for a successful digital transformation. Committing to visibility and transparency throughout the deployment process will be critical, so that key stakeholders can understand what’s going on at all times. The same McKinsey study also found that companies whose senior leaders make digital transformation a “top priority” are 1.5 times more likely to see results that beat their expectations . Computer Vision Consulting Step 3: Train the System Like children and dogs, computer vision models must be well-trained. The training process can mean the difference between a model that achieves world-class performance, and a model that performs barely better than chance. The sub-steps required in the process of computer vision training include: Sourcing and/or generating a large, diverse dataset. Dividing the original dataset into training, validation, and test sets, each one representative of the larger dataset. Selecting the right deep learning model architecture. Training the system, assessing its performance on the training and validation sets, and adjusting hyper-parameters such as the length of training or the size of the model. This cycle is repeated as necessary until you obtain a satisfactory level of performance. Assessing the system’s final performance on the test set, which thus far\\xa0the trained model has not seen. Computer Vision Consulting Step 4: Prove the Concept Once you’ve gained some confidence in your trained computer vision system , you can dip your toes in the water by deploying it as a proof of concept\\xa0(POC). Having a successful POC will ensure you’re on the right track, and can help seal the deal for stakeholders to invest more time, money, and resources in the project. To identify the best choices for a proof of concept, make sure that the domain in which the project will be deployed is relevant to your business strategy\\xa0as a whole. Try to strike the right balance between a domain that’s adequately complex and relevant, without being too difficult to implement. In addition, your choices of metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) should be easily measurable, in order to understand the impact of the project. Computer Vision Consulting Step 5: Generate an ROI Last but certainly\\xa0not least, your computer vision project needs to generate a return on investment before it can be judged a success. Patience may be key here: many tech executives expect the ROI of their AI projects to take as long as 3 to 5 years . Determining the ROI of computer vision and AI initiatives may include, but is certainly not limited to, cold financial figures. The factors below are just a few to consider when assessing a project’s ROI: Savings in labor costs by automating manual work, and/or the benefits of redirecting human employees to higher-level activities. Cost savings as a result of issues such as bottlenecks, downtime, and maintenance. Providing higher-quality products or a better customer experience. Improved safety and security measures. The benefits of making your organization more flexible, agile, and adaptable. Conclusion By following the 5 steps above, you’ll find that your computer vision project will be a lot easier to implement—and much more likely to succeed. Building your own computer vision solution can be complicated and challenging, which is why you can improve your experience with the help of computer vision consulting experts like Chooch AI.

Listen now at\\xa0HCI Podcast Site for more interviews or read the transcript below. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Welcome to the Human Capital Innovations Podcast. In this HCI podcast episode, I talk with Michael Liou about the latest trends and developments related to AI in the workplace . Michael: Thanks Jonathan. Thanks for having me today. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Yeah, it’s a real pleasure. I’m excited to have this conversation with you. It was fun getting to know you a little bit in the pre-interview as we were just talking and getting to know each other and getting ready for the episode and you have expertise in an area that I know listeners are super tuned into. That is AI; AI in the workplace . And how do we leverage artificial intelligence and deep machine learning to better our workplaces in a variety of ways? So that’ll be the topic that we explore together today, and I’m really excited for the conversation as we get started. I wanted to share Michael’s bio with everybody. Michael Liou is VP of Strategy and Growth at Chooch AI , where he brings a unique blend of strategy, marketing investment, venture capital, and product development skills. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Michael brings an extensive background in venture capital where he has been an active early stage investor, investing in over 100 tech startups, including notable unicorns, such as Robinhood. Michael worked with Citi Private bank, serving ultra high net worth family offices in the Bay Area. Prior to his role at Citi, Michael founded Anvil Capital Advisors. He also spent 18 years at Goldman Sachs as a Managing Director overseeing several business units, both in New York and San Francisco. He holds a Master of Business Administration from NYU Stern School of Business, a Master of Science from Columbia University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and a Bachelor of Science from Brown University. He recently served on the board of the San Mateo Public Library Foundation. It is a real pleasure to have you Michael, so much expertise, such a rich career, and so many insights. I’m sure you’re going to be able to provide, as we launch into the conversation about artificial intelligence in the workplace. Before we do that, though, is there anything else you would like to share with listeners by way of your personal background or context that would lend itself to this conversation? Michael: Well, thanks Jonathan. I think probably the only thing I would like to share is in my last 10 years of investing, I’ve encountered a lot of great companies and ironically Chooch AI was actually the first company I invested in, actually back in 2016. And it actually was my largest seed check in the last five plus years or so. And so I’ve been quite fortunate to have a front row seat watching this company grow and develop this technology for the first three and a half years or so. And then find it somewhat ironic that in December of 2019, I was asked by the CEO Emrah Gultekin to actually join as Head of Strategy and Growth. And so now I find myself back in technology where I originally started with Bell Labs Research back in the Eighties, now working with some of the best and brightest people at this AI company. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Yeah, that’s really great. And again, you have a really nice complimentary set of experiences in your portfolio, the work that you’ve done over the years throughout your career. And it’s led you to this space now where you get to, as VP of Strategy, you get to lead out with this AI development and integration across organizations. So you’re attuned to all the latest trends, all of the latest developments in the field. And I’m super interested in learning from you today and having a conversation about what those are and how we can best as people managers, as organizational leaders, how we can best leverage the existing technologies to improve the lives of our people to improve the situations that we find ourselves in within the workplace. So why don’t we start by just exploring some of the current trends? What are you seeing in this space and what is, well let’s start there? What are the current AI trends? And then we can start to move into how we see that moving into the workplace. Michael: Sure Jonathan, and thanks again. So when we think about our capabilities as a visual AI company or computer vision, we understand that there are still some bottlenecks out there in terms of the development cycle and what this company has done has really shortened that cycle in terms of generating data sets, in generating these computer vision models, but also putting them out on edge devices. And that means that the compute is actually happening right on the factory floor, right in the warehouse, right in a retail outlet where we can now maintain a really accurate and a high speed of predictions, if you will. And at the same time, maintain that privacy and protection of data, which is really, really important. This is a trend that we’ve seen across all industries. Michael: And then second, if you think about visual AI as a sensor, we can actually enhance human productivity, reduce risk and increase yields by kind of replacing some of the more tedious and manual tasks that humans have to go through every single day and then allowing those humans to potentially perform higher level functions. So imagine an assembly line of bottles are coming through and using machine vision to detect the defects on caps and labels. Well, if we can kind of automate that we can potentially re task people to do more complex tasks versus just looking endlessly at a line of bottles, looking for defects as an example. Or imagine- Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Can I just comment on that as one back, a lifetime ago, back when I was a young and saving up money to go to college. I spent my time on an assembly line in a factory. So I’ve had some of that experience. It’s not a pleasant job. You know, it’s very tedious. It’s mind numbing work. Time moves so slowly. If you want to leverage the potential of people, having them doing those kinds of manual menial tasks day in and day out is not the best way. And so I just wanted to note really quickly cause you made the comment, these technologies… I know people get afraid. They fear AI because they worry about displacement of workers. They worry about automation and the loss of jobs. And certainly there will be tasks and even some jobs and perhaps even some professions that are replaced by machines, but there’s going to be so many more opportunities that are created and new jobs, new tasks, new roles that are going to be created because of the technology, just like we’ve seen at every stage of the industrial revolution. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: And as we talk about being in this being industrial revolution 4.0., yeah, we’re going to have certain jobs that go away. We’re going to have certain tasks that go away, but to the betterment of the workers, ultimately as we re-skill and up-skill and do more complex things that are more interesting and engaging and ultimately more fulfilling. We’ll be able to thrive more, I think, as people in the workplace. So that’s just a quick comment I wanted to make, because I really do think that that’s an important benefit to everything that we see coming down the pipeline with AI, machine learning, automation and such. Michael: Absolutely Jonathan. And as a matter of fact, one of the other advantages that, computer vision can provide is that degree of consistency and uptime. So imagine a warehouse scenario or an airport scenario where we’re trying to look for people who are wearing the appropriate safety gear or looking for people of interest. The human being, when they’re focusing on these tasks, can be efficient up to a certain point. And then thereafter, fatigue can potentially set in. You might be texting your friend. You might have to eat lunch or go to the bathroom, whereas a camera outfitted with the appropriate, accurate computer vision models can tirelessly continue to perform those menial tasks and also aggregate that data too. And that data can be stored and analyzed for future analysis. Michael: So if you’re in a workplace, let’s say a warehouse and you want to demonstrate a culture of safety and compliance, and you can count how many times people wearing their hard hats and ensuring people were under safety vests and detecting any smoke or fire. When it’s very, very early stage, you’re going to have fewer accidents. You can decrease the risk of workers in a workplace . And ultimately, you’re going to be able to decrease frequency and severity. And if that can be demonstrated to an insurance company, there is a significant chance that you can reduce the amount of premium that you paid to the insurance company of workers’ compensation. So there isn’t a real ROI here, not to mention the cultural and safety indemnity and long-term, and short-term disability benefits that come along with that reduction of risk. Michael: Yeah, absolutely. In that, the risk management component is one that I have to admit, as people talk about the benefits of AI, that’s not the first thing that most people start to talk about. And it’s not the first thing I usually think about. But as an HR professional in the HR and people management space, safety and compliance is a big deal. And if you want to make sure, the premium issue and the cost savings component alone is worth doing this. But also, just the human cost of pain and suffering due to injuries or heaven forbid even death in the workplace; if we can eliminate more of those types of incidences. That’s to everyone’s benefit, that’s the organization’s bottom line benefit, but it’s also to the team and the individuals’ benefit because they’re taken care of and safety and compliance is a really tough nut to crack. Michael: I think anyone who works in that space knows how difficult it is and best intentions don’t mean much of anything. If you don’t actually have the systems and processes in place to make sure that your people are kept safe and they are complying with the rules and the regulations. And so having the AI to assist you like you’re describing will be a really huge benefit to organizations. Not just to the bottom line, but like you said, to the culture of safety, to the culture of, not just physical safety. We want psychological safety in the workplace . We don’t want people fearing how they’re going to be taken care of at work. We want to take that off the table. We want that to just be a given that people are safe, people will be taken care of. Michael: Absolutely. There’s the financial repercussions. And then as you mentioned, there’s the cultural repercussions, culturally meaning of reputational risk, a compliance risk, sanctioned risk, and of course, litigation risk as well too might. So why open yourself up as some of these near misses or behaviors can be tracked and potentially buttoned down so that you reduce the risk overall. It could be something as simple as detecting puddles or slippery surfaces before someone falls down, to sending an alert to someone who is on a ladder who should be wearing a safety harness before they ascend a ladder? Everyone likes to save time, but, you should also make sure that people aren’t texting while they’re driving a forklift. Or texting when they’re near a earth mover, moving around on a commercial work site. So there are many applications of computer vision that seems somewhat innocuous, but when you add them all up, actually can lead to a greater culture and environment of safety and lower risk. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Yeah. I love it. And I just heard, I’m sure you have too. I’ve heard so many horror stories of people who are just, again, they’re cutting corners, not because they’re lazy, usually. They’re cutting corners because they’re trying to be efficient. They’re trying to move more quickly. They’re trying to produce for company. And a lot of times there is performance pressure being put on them. And so, they have to harness up and they’re like, “Ah, it’s just a really quick thing. I can just jump on real quick and I’ll be up and down, you know? And if I have to harness up, it’s going to take more time.” And so they just want to do it quickly. That kind of thing, those types of incidences happen all the time. And they’re so avoidable, not just because you have someone monitoring and people know that they’re monitored, and then they get the alerts like you’re describing. But it holds management accountable too, to not put undue pressure on time and efficiency when it is sacrificing safety. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Because oftentimes when I’ve gone into organizations and I’ve seen a poor safety record, it’s usually a dual problem. There’s some training issues usually that have to be put in place. There’s some processes that need to be fine tuned to make sure that people know what they need to be doing, how and when and all of that. But usually there’s also a cultural component due to the pressure being put on the workers by administrators that is unsustainable. And it leads to people cutting corners and those safety corners in the long run are going to be very much more detrimental to the success of the organization than if they take a couple extra minutes to practice those safety procedures. So as you’re describing, this visual component, it’s an extra layer, it’s an extra mechanism to ensure that you’re holding everyone accountable, that you’re making sure that everyone is taking safety very, very seriously. So what are some of the other trends that you see out there right now, and that your organization’s working with in relation to AI in the workplace? Commercial Break: I’m excited to announce the publication of my new book from HCI Press, “The Alchemy of Truly Remarkable Leadership: Ordinary, Everyday Actions That Produce Extraordinary Results”. Consider how the nature of work has shifted over the past 50 years with increased globalization, rapid technological advancement, and the shift in economic composition. The average job of today looks very different than the average job of 50 years ago. What will the jobs and organizations of tomorrow look like? Moreover, what does this all mean for organizational leaders? What are the core competencies and capabilities of organizations and their leadership that are prepared for continued disruption and geopolitical and socioeconomic shifts? Regardless of what the future holds, increasingly leaders need to be socially minded, data-driven, decisive ,champions of talent and disruptors of the traditional notions of leadership, teams, organizations, and work. “The Alchemy of Truly Remarkable Leadership” will help you to explore your own leadership competencies and capabilities and consider ways to apply and implement them into your workplace and personal life. Michael: I would say that safety and security in the workplace is certainly paramount because every industry has a warehouse or every industry has a logistics staging center. And if you think about the trends in retail with omnichannel being here to stay, you’ve got more pressure to build these logistics centers and these fulfillment warehouses. So there is this kind of breakneck speed to build all this infrastructure, which means more and more people will be entering to the workforce that will be exposed to these dangers. And so, as a result, in this kind of hurry to be competitive, there is this risk again that people may cut corners. There is an OSHA requirement that if you have an injury or accident in the workplace, this needs to be reported in 24 hours. And I’m pretty sure that’s not being complied to. Michael: And you might be able to get away with cutting corners every single day, but all you need is that literally 1% chance to come to fruition where there’s a death or dismemberment, and it just ruins everything. Ruins morale, increases risk. There’s a ton of paperwork needs to be fulfilled. And so again, ensuring that there’s this compliance and culture of safety, I think is paramount. And this goes for the construction industry as well, where you could argue they’re even more dangerous jobs like roofing as an example, which have some of the higher risks out there, or jobs in slaughterhouses, which are also a very, very risky as well. But we’ve also focused on a public safety and so there’s a little bit of overlap. So in addition to detecting PPE equipment in the industrial workplace, we’ve also developed models for things like smoke detection, fire detection, fall detection in public areas, nursing homes, hospitals, and we’ve also developed weapons detection to handgun, knife and rifle. Michael: And if one’s able to detect these anomalies earlier, than potentially emergency response can be activated more quickly and render aid or help all a bit more expeditiously onsite. So imagine a mall where you typically have video cameras everywhere, and three people sitting in the security room, looking for events that don’t happen. It might be better if they could actually be walking the premises and having an AI to say, “Hey, there’s a fight breaking out in front of Macy’s” or “Hey, there’s a slippery surface in front of JC Penny’s. Someone better mop that up before they crack their skull. And then sue the mall operator as an example.” So I think public safety is also another area. And this blends into the overall arching theme of smart city. Can we enable computer vision to help our cities safer? Ensuring that people are not driving and using mobile phones at the same time, making sure they have their seat belts on, detecting any areas where there might be a violence breaking out, or there may be a fire or smoke breaking out. Michael: The current state of technology for detecting smoke and fire indoors is thermal sensors and smoke detectors. Well, in 30 foot ceiling warehouses, those flames need to be pretty big before they start setting those things off. What would happen if we could actually use computer vision to detect smoke and fire at a much earlier stage? You might be able to prevent a full-blown conflagration and a three alarm response from the fire department. You might be able to put it out on your own or elicit a smaller response and be a little bit more preventive. Now I must caution that these technologies aren’t regulated. Obviously smoke detectors and heat sensors are regulated and do provide a very good level of safety. But we do think that computer vision, our AI models, could be complimentary into these existing technologies and again, potentially save lives and damage and speed response or initiate sponsor faster. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Yeah, yeah. And that speed response, I think, is one of the critical components whenever you’re dealing with these sorts of issues. And you’ve raised a couple of times now, not just the traditional OSHA safety type concerns, but also things like weapon detection. I don’t want to get into a whole political conversation on guns rights and gun issues. But the reality is that we live in a current climate and context where gun violence is fairly prevalent. And so if you can have this type of technology utilized in order to recognize when there’s a threat and have quick rapid response to that threat, think about the potential number of lives that can be saved. And some of these incidences, we hear about there’s one, what was it just a couple of weeks ago in Colorado, we had another incident. And so if you can utilize this type of technology, I think it’s a really great opportunity to provide that level of safety and security for people. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: And you also brought up the regulatory piece and how that currently isn’t in place for this technology. My next kind of thought feeds off of that comment. And that is, what are some of the ethical considerations that we need to really be thoughtful about and careful about as we’re integrating more of these AI technologies into the workplace, or really into our communities at large? Because certainly, in terms of the surveillance piece and some of these other elements, there’s certainly a potential for concern. So what is your organization doing to help with that kind of ethical AI drive to make sure that we’re doing things properly and what should organizations and leaders listening to this podcast today? What should they be considering as they consider those ethical components to utilizing your technology and other similar technologies? Michael: Yeah, this is a really, really important topic, Jonathan, when it comes to computer vision. And if you think about the models that are out there, there are two main concerns that you can now break this into. One is obviously privacy THe second is bias and bias in models comes from a bias in data that helps train those models. So that’s really, really important. And when people talk about bias, they primarily focus more on the official recognition aspects. So it’s known that a lot of, some of the public models that are out there, I have biases towards people of color, people who are Asian of descent as an example. And so people have to kind of go back to the drawing board, right? If they’re going to use facial, they need to use it in a much less biased manner. Michael: So that’s one concern. Second is the privacy issue in the sense that most stores have camera monitoring systems already. And those videos are actually being digitally stored already. And the difference is that typically these videos are monitored by a staff of humans, either onsite or offsite for any security. And so they’re kind of watching you anyway, right? What we need to be careful about with computer vision is that we need to use it for the basis of good – for the public good, if you will. And so when people say, “Are you recording my face? Can you recognize who we are?”, it depends upon what computer models are actually loaded into the system. So, as an example, if I just have fire and smoke detection and fall detection loaded into our system, then that’s all it’s going to detect. Michael: So it’s not going to take human faces. It’s not going to do demographics. It’s not going to determine racial or ethnicity amongst the population. And so there is a degree of control that management has in terms of when they implement certain particular models. You could implement weapons detection, fire and smoke for just a public safety aspect. And again, there’s no facial recognition happening. Those cameras, there’s no database to cross reference people. So I think it’s important to kind of clarify what can and cannot be done. Michael: There are companies who do focus on facial, and there are companies who have extensive databases of people’s identities matched up with faces. I can tell you at Chooch AI , we do not do that. We do have private enterprise inquiries where people who want to use facial for things like airplane check-in, airplane boarding, a cruise line check-in, a hospitality access control in the public and private sector, into restricted areas. And I think that’s fine, right? As a matter of fact, when you use facial for access control, you kind of eliminate the risk for any type of potential compromise, like giving someone your passcode or giving someone your key card. And actually made things a little bit safer. But again, I think it’s important to understand that the computer vision models will do and be trained specifically for its particular task. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Yeah. Excellent. Excellent. I think those are all important points and we really just scratched the surface of the conversation in relation to the ethical components. Really, we scratched the surface on all the AI potential within the workplace, but those ethical components, we can’t forget about that. And sometimes we get super excited about the engineering piece of the technology and the capabilities. But if we sever the continued development of the technology from the ethical conversations, then that’s where we can take the humanity out of the workplace potentially and find ourselves in other difficult situations. I appreciate that lens that you added to our conversation here today. And I would encourage listeners, have these meaningful conversations with your C-suite leadership and leadership down the organization and talk about how the types of applications that Michael has been describing, how it could be utilized while keeping in mind that those ethical components in the protections for your people and for the customers. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Michael, it has been a real pleasure talking with you today. I do want to be mindful of your time. I recognize you’re very busy and we’ll need to move on to the rest of your day. But before we close, I wanted to give you a chance to reach out or to share with listeners how they can get connected with you, find out more about your organization and how you can benefit them. And then give us the final word on the topic for today. Michael: Yeah, sure Jonathan. More information can be found on our website at chooch.ai. It’s a fairly rich website with a number of different links to videos, capabilities, verticals, as well as demo links to our best capabilities. We are very horizontal on Jonathan. So we have applications in many different industries, ranging from oil and gas to healthcare, media, retail, industrial warehouses, and even geospatial capabilities. So I think the team here has worked very, very hard in creating a very powerful and flexible platform. And we’re looking to help other organizations. I hate to overuse this word, use computer vision for digital transformation, reduce risk, potentially enhance safety, increase yield, decrease costs, and just make their workplace more efficient. Jonathan H. Westover, Ph.D.: Wonderful. Thank you, Michael. It has been a real pleasure talking with you. I encourage listeners to reach out, get connected with Michael, find out more about what he and his company can do for you. And as always, I hope everyone can stay healthy and safe, that you can find meaning and purpose at work each and every day. And I hope you all have a great week.

       "  'text': 'Computer Vision for Infrastructure Inspection & Monitoring | Chooch Large-scale industrial operations manage infrastructure networks spanning hundreds of miles. An energy company, for example, needs to maintain vast networks of electrical wires, distribution poles, transmission towers, electrical substations, and other critical assets. Because these assets are often located in remote and dangerous locations, inspecting them for maintenance issues demands high-risk expeditions, skilled labor, and an enormous amount of time and financial resources. Today, computer vision technology empowers industrial companies to achieve safer, more accurate, and more cost-effective inspections of key infrastructure components. Whether the computer vision inspection strategy involves IoT-connected smart cameras installed in remote locations, drones collecting visual data by air – or satellite imagery – a well-trained visual AI system can detect maintenance problems, environmental hazards, and safety concerns with higher degrees of accuracy than traditional methods of infrastructure inspection. Get a demo of AI for infrastructure inspection with Industrial AI . Traditional Methods of Infrastructure Inspection The inspection and maintenance of critical infrastructure components is a necessary part of nearly every large-scale industry. Some common infrastructure types requiring inspections include: Power lines Utility infrastructure Construction sites Cell towers Coastal shoreline erosion Bridges Roads and interstates Hydroelectric dams Wind turbines Solar farms Industrial agriculture Wastewater and effluent Each of the above use cases has developed its own standards and procedures for infrastructure inspection and maintenance – including inspections for compliance with environmental statutes. Traditional methods for performing these inspections may include the use of: Human visual inspectors Photogrammetry Orthomosaics 3D models Geospatial information services Aerial inspections by helicopter Drone-based aerial photography Satellite imagery LiDAR Ultrasound Liquid penetration inspection (LPI) Radiography Infrared camera footage Surveillance cameras installed at various inspection sites Aside from using advanced technology, trained and experienced professionals are an integral part of most inspection processes. These inspectors frequently endure dangerous conditions to perform in-person evaluations using the human eye alone with no special instrumentation. Often traveling to remote areas by helicopter, working out of bucket trucks – or climbing up towers, wind turbines, bridges, and electrical distribution poles – human inspectors need to evaluate the condition of key assets to answer a host of questions. Infrastructure inspectors may need to consider questions such as: Is it rusty? Is it structurally sound? Are trees growing over a transformer box? Are guy-wires intact? Are key actions happening on schedule? Is wastewater flowing properly through drain pipes? Is it overheating? Is it the wrong color? Are power lines broken or hanging too low? Is it leaking? The Challenges of Traditional Infrastructure Inspections Large-scale industrial operations spend millions of dollars each year to conduct visual inspections that rely on human eyes and human understanding without any special equipment. Until the recent introduction of computer vision technology , the use of human inspectors for these visual evaluations was a necessity. However, the following challenges continue to plague any inspection activities that rely on human eyes: Slow and laborious: Getting human workers on-site to perform inspections at thousands of sites across hundreds of miles of distance is difficult, costly, and time-consuming – resulting in infrequent inspections and detection delays. For example, a wastewater treatment facility could be dumping contaminated effluent into a river for days – even months – before a human inspector detects the problem. Similarly, the infrequent inspection of hydroelectric facilities, cell towers, wind turbines, and other infrastructure components means that an inexpensive problem could grow into a devastating catastrophe. Risky and dangerous: The process of sending human workers to remote sites to climb cell towers and key pieces of infrastructure is fraught with dangers. For example, workers climbing cell towers face the risk of electrocution, inclement weather (excessive wind, rain, lightning, hail, and snow), objects falling at high speeds, and protective equipment failures. The remoteness of inspection sites – combined with dangerous inspection tasks and safety training failures – elevates the chances and severity of injuries. Error-prone: Whether they are performing inspections on-site, or remotely while viewing visual data collected by cameras, drones, and other detection equipment, inspectors can only achieve certain levels of accuracy due to the inherent limitations of their human faculties. Human inspectors are commonly overworked, lacking adequate rest, bored, inadequately trained, or without sufficient experience and expertise. These challenges result in errors, mistakes, and inconsistent inspection results. Expensive: Hiring, training, and employing skilled human inspectors is costly – so is transporting inspectors to and from remote inspection sites. Utility companies pay as much as $1,000 per mile for aerial inspections by helicopter. Insurance costs related to these often dangerous inspection activities are another significant expense. Consider the simple inspection task of monitoring for tree overgrowth around power lines. It’s not uncommon for tree branches to break through power lines, destabilize distribution poles, and short-circuit transformers. Early detection and trimming of trees is essential to prevent blackouts, fires, and electrocution hazards . However, it’s costly, time-consuming – and virtually impossible – to detect all instances of tree overgrowth. Invariably, an undetected branch could grow in such a way that leads to an expensive or catastrophic problem. Another simple yet problematic inspection task relates to monitoring wastewater effluent for signs of particles, discharges, and discoloration. Human inspectors need to continually check discharge pipes to ensure that wastewater is running clean and on schedule. If not, the problem could represent a costly violation of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria or Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) standards. However, due to the limited number of human inspectors – and logistical challenges associated with constant monitoring – it’s not uncommon for factories, plants, and wastewater treatment facilities to unknowingly discharge untreated water directly into the ocean – sometimes for weeks or months before they detect it. Leveraging Computer Vision for Better Infrastructure Inspections Computer vision technology provides a cost-effective solution for conducting accurate and timely inspections of industrial infrastructure assets. In addition to achieving more accurate and consistent results than human-led inspections, visual AI for infrastructure inspection is dramatically safer and more affordable. Computer vision strategies for infrastructure inspection leverage the following features: High-definition IoT-connected cameras – including infrared cameras – mounted in remote locations that observe site conditions. Deployment of drones for aerial footage, visual measurements, and automatic identification of potential problems. High-resolution satellite topography imagery to show the current condition and status of assets on the ground. Edge servers running sophisticated AI models that analyze and interpret visual data, identify maintenance issues, detect environmental hazards , and spot instances of fire and overheating. Instant alerts, reports, and metrics sent to decision-makers for immediate action on potential problems. With Chooch, companies that manage large infrastructure networks can rapidly train computer vision models to detect all types of visually perceivable problems and maintenance concerns. Through the use of drones, on-site surveillance cameras, and satellite imagery, Chooch AI systems can monitor critical infrastructure assets without the time, risk, and cost of transporting human inspectors to remote locations – and do so faster and more accurately. Chooch offers industrial companies immediate access to a wide library of pre-built visual AI models for the most common inspection use cases.

The fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence , along with subfields such as computer vision, have never been a hotter employment prospect. According to Indeed, computer vision engineers in the U.S. have one of the highest salaries in the technology industry, with an average base pay over $158,000 . But what do computer vision engineers do, exactly, and what skills to you need to be a computer vision engineer? What does a computer vision engineer do? The job roles and responsibilities of computer vision engineers may include: Designing and developing systems and software that use computer vision. Creating and/or using computer vision libraries and frameworks. Sourcing and preparing computer vision training datasets. Experimenting with computer vision models by training and testing models and analyzing the results. Reading computer vision research papers to learn about new developments in the field. The computer vision engineer skills you need to have What skills do computer vision engineers need in order to carry out these job roles and responsibilities? Most employers prefer computer vision engineers to have education (i.e. a bachelor’s, master’s, or PhD) in a subject such as computer science, engineering, or mathematics. This education should likely have included coursework on topics such as computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, image processing, signal processing, data science, and software development. Mathematics courses on linear algebra, calculus, and probability and statistics are also highly useful for computer vision engineers. In addition to this theoretical background, computer vision engineers also need practical skills to implement real-world solutions. Computer vision engineers should be able to train and optimize AI models and deploy them in production scenarios. Familiarity with libraries and frameworks for computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, and data science—e.g. OpenCV, sklearn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow—is highly valuable. The Python programming language currently dominates the field, with 57 percent of machine learning developers and data scientists using Python. In addition, knowing other languages is also helpful: OpenCV is primarily written in C++ (although it has interfaces for Python and Java), and MATLAB is very popular for image processing. The future of computer vision engineer jobs Want to become a computer vision engineer?

       "  'text': 'Applications of Machine Learning for Computer Vision | Chooch AI is nothing new to anyone reading this computer vision blog . Siri, Alexa, and web chatbots have made AI commonplace.\\xa0Yet, computer vision gives AI a pair of eyes that can be taught with machine learning. What is machine learning? Machine learning is the application of statistical models and algorithms to perform tasks without the need to introduce explicit instructions. It relies on inference and pattern recognition using existing data sets. It requires minimal assistance from programmers in making decisions. What is computer vision? Computer vision refers to the ability of a machine to understand images and videos. It mimics the capability of human vision by acquiring, processing, and analyzing real-world data and synthesizing them into useful information. It uses a camera to capture images and videos to analyze, which can then be purposed for object recognition, motion estimation, and video tracking. 6 applications of computer vision Machine learning and computer vision are often used together to effectively acquire, analyze, and interpret captured visual data. Here are six applications of these technologies to help illustrate some of the benefits Chooch is seeing in the marketplace. 1. Automotive Self-driving cars are slowly making their way into the market, with more companies looking for innovative ways to bring more electric vehicles onto the road. Computer vision technology helps these self-driving vehicles ‘see’ the environment while machine learning algorithms create the “brains” that help that computer vision interpret the objects around the car. Self-driving cars are equipped with multiple cameras to provide a complete 360-degree view of the environment within a range of hundreds of meters. Tesla cars, for instance, uses up to 8 surround cameras to achieve this feat . Twelve ultrasonic sensors for detecting hard and soft objects on the road and a forward-facing radar that enables the detection of other vehicles even through rain or fog are also installed to complement the cameras. With large amounts of data being fed into the vehicle, a simple computer won’t be enough to handle the influx of information. This is why all self-driving cars have an onboard computer with computer vision features created through machine learning. The cameras and sensors are tasked to both detect and classify objects in the environment – like pedestrians. The location, density, shape, and depth of the objects have to be considered instantaneously to enable the rest of the driving system to make appropriate decisions. All these computations are only possible through the integration of machine learning and deep neural networks which results in features like pedestrian detection. Fig. 1. A Tesla car’s vision (Source: Tesla ) Road conditions, traffic situations, and other environmental factors don’t remain the same every time you get in the car. Having a computer simply memorize what it sees won’t be useful when changes are suddenly introduced into the environment. Machine learning helps the computer “understand” what it sees, allowing the system to quickly adapt to whichever environment it’s brought into. That’s artificial intelligence. 2. Banking Banks are also using computer vision and machine learning to quickly authenticate documents such as IDs, checks, and passports. A customer can just take a photo of themselves or their ID using a mobile device to authorize transactions, but liveliness detection and anti-spoofing can be acquired through machine learning and then detected by computer vision. Chooch features\\xa0facial authentication\\xa0for banking. Some banks are starting to implement online deposit of checks through a mobile phone app. Using computer vision and machine learning, the system is designed to read the important details on an uploaded photo of a check for deposit. The algorithm can automatically correct distortions, skews, warps, and poor lighting conditions present on the image. There’s no need to go to the bank to deposit checks or process other transactions that used to be done over-the-counter. The Mercantile Bank of Michigan which adopted this system was able to realize a 20% increase in its online bank users . 3. Industrial facilities management The industrial sector has critical infrastructure which must always be monitored, secured, and regulated to avoid any kind of loss or damage. In the oil industry, for example, remote oil wells must be monitored regularly to ensure smooth operation. However, with sites deployed in several regions, it would be very costly to do site visits every so often. Using machine learning and computer vision, oil companies can monitor sites 24/7 without having to deploy employees. The system can be programmed to read tank levels, spot leaks, and ensure the security of the facilities. Alerts are raised whenever an anomaly is detected in any of the sites, enabling a quick response from the management team. The way computer vision is used in the scenario above can be adopted by chemical factories, refineries, and even nuclear power plants. Sensors and camera feed must all be connected and handled by a powerful AI fully capable of utilizing computer vision and machine learning to detect pedestrians and vehicles approaching or entering the facilities. 4. Healthcare There are several applications for machine learning and computer vision in healthcare . Accurately classifying illnesses is becoming better now, thanks to computer vision technology. With machine learning training, AI can “learn” what diseases look like in medical imaging. It is now even possible to diagnose patients using a mobile phone, eliminating the need to line up in hospitals for an appointment. Gauss Surgical , a medical technology company, is using cloud-based computer vision technology and machine learning algorithms to estimate blood loss during surgical operations. Using an iPad-based app and a camera, the captured images of suction canisters and surgical sponges are analyzed to predict the possibility of hemorrhage. They’re found to be more accurate than the visual estimates of doctors during medical procedures. Chooch is developing several initiatives in the computer vision for healthcare space. For more information please contact us about use cases. 5. Retail Chooch is powering identification and recommendation engines for several high traffic sites, and we are also working on inventory systems, but computer vision is also being used in the physical world by other companies. Amazon, notably, recently opened their Amazon Go store where shoppers can just pick up any item and leave the store without having to go through a checkout counter. Automatic electronic payments are made possible by equipping the Go store with cameras with computer vision capabilities. Fig. 2. An Amazon Go branch (Source: CNET ) Cameras are placed on aisles and shelves to monitor when a customer picks up or returns an item. Each customer is assigned a virtual basket that gets filled according to the item they take from the shelves. When done, customers can freely walk out of the store and the cost will be charged to their Amazon account. Cashiers have been eliminated through this program, a personal cost savings, allowing for a faster and more convenient checkout process. Security won’t be an issue also since the system can track multiple individuals simultaneously without using facial recognition. Amazon has also applied for a patent for a virtual mirror. This technology makes use of computer vision to project the image of the individual looking at the mirror. Various superimpositions like clothes and accessories can then be placed over the reflection, allowing the shopper to try different items without needing to physically put them on. 6. Security The security sector benefits greatly the most from the perfect unison between machine learning and computer vision. For instance, airports, stadiums, and even streets are installed with facial recognition systems to identify terrorists and wanted criminals. Cameras can quickly match an individual’s face against a database and prompt authorities on the presence of known threats in the facility. Offices are also installing CCTV cameras to identify who enters and exits the premises. Some rooms accessible only to authorized personnel can be set with an automatic alarm when an unrecognized individual is identified by the camera linked to a computer vision system. Retail security has also been quick to take up computer vision and machine learning to improve the safety of business assets. Retailers have been using computer technology to reduce theft and losses at their branches by installing intelligent cameras in the vicinity. Checkout can also be monitored. Using computer vision technology , cameras can be placed over checkout counters to monitor product scans. Any item that crosses the scanner without being tagged as a sale is labeled by the software as a loss. The report is then sent to the management to handle the issue and prevent similar incidents from happening. Computer vision possibilities Computer vision has a wide variety of applications in different industries. From banking and automotive to sports and security, the power of cameras combined with machine learning poses endless possibilities for improving business performance. Chooch offers different forms of AI Vision technology that can improve the productivity and efficiency of your marketing and security efforts.

       "  'text': 'Industrial Computer Vision Inspection for Monitoring Infrastructure | Chooch Large-scale industrial companies rely heavily on experienced human employees to routinely inspect vast infrastructure networks. However, these inspection activities are expensive, time-consuming, dangerous, and highly prone to mistakes and errors. Now, industrial companies are adopting computer vision to radically improve the speed, safety, accuracy, and cost-efficiency of infrastructure inspection. Large-scale industrial operations manage infrastructure networks spanning hundreds of miles. An energy company, for example, needs to maintain vast networks of electrical wires, distribution poles, transmission towers, electrical substations, and other critical assets. Because these assets are often located in remote and dangerous locations, inspecting them for maintenance issues demands high-risk expeditions, skilled labor, and an enormous amount of time and financial resources. Today, computer vision technology empowers industrial companies to achieve safer, more accurate, and more cost-effective inspections of key infrastructure components. Traditional Methods of Infrastructure Inspection The inspection and maintenance of critical infrastructure components is a necessary part of nearly every large-scale industry. Some common infrastructure types requiring inspections include: Power lines Utility infrastructure Construction sites Cell towers Roads and interstates Wind turbines Industrial agriculture Wastewater and effluent Aside from using advanced technology, trained and experienced professionals are an integral part of most inspection processes. These inspectors frequently endure dangerous conditions to perform in-person evaluations using the human eye alone with no special instrumentation. Often traveling to remote areas by helicopter, working out of bucket trucks – or climbing up towers, wind turbines, bridges, and electrical distribution poles – human inspectors need to evaluate the condition of key assets to answer a host of questions like: Is it rusty? Is it structurally sound? Are trees growing over a transformer box? Are guy-wires intact? Is it leaking? And a great deal more Leveraging Computer Vision for Better Infrastructure Inspections Computer vision technology provides a cost-effective solution for conducting accurate and timely inspections of industrial infrastructure assets. In addition to achieving more accurate and consistent results than human-led inspections, visual AI for infrastructure inspection is dramatically safer and more affordable. Computer vision strategies for infrastructure inspection leverage the following features: High-definition IoT-connected cameras – including infrared cameras – mounted in remote locations that observe site conditions. Deployment of drones for aerial footage, visual measurements, and automatic identification of potential problems. High-resolution satellite topography imagery to show the current condition and status of assets on the ground. Edge servers running sophisticated AI models that analyze and interpret visual data, identify maintenance issues, detect environmental hazards, and spot instances of fire and overheating. Instant alerts, reports, and metrics sent to decision-makers for immediate action on potential problems. With Chooch AI Vision , industrial companies gain immediate access to a wide library of pre-built visual AI models for the most common inspection use cases.

       "  'text': 'What is AI model? | Chooch An AI (artificial intelligence) model is a program that has been trained on a set of data (called the training set ) to recognize certain types of patterns. AI models use various types of algorithms to reason over and learn from this data, with the overarching goal of solving business problems. There are many different fi elds that use AI models with different levels of complexity and purposes, including computer vision , robotics, and natural language processing. As mentioned above, a machine learning algorithm is a procedure that learns from data to perform pattern recognition and creates a machine learning model. Below is a sampling of just a few simple machine learning algorithms: k -nearest neighbors: The k -nearest neighbors algorithm is used to classify data points based on the classification of their k nearest neighbors (where k is some integer). For example, if we have k = 5, then for each new data point, we will give it the same classification as the majority(or the plurality) of its closest neighbors in the data set. Linear regression: Linear regression attempts to define the relationship between multiple variables by fitting a linear equation to a dataset. The output of a linear regression model can then be used to estimate the value of missing points in the dataset. k -means: The k -means algorithm is used to separate a dataset into k different clusters (where k is some integer). We start by randomly choosing k points (called centroids) in space, and assigning each point to the closest centroid. Next, we calculate the mean of all the points that have been assigned to the same centroid. This mean value then becomes the cluster’s new centroid. We repeat the algorithm until it converges, i.e. the position of the centroids does not change. AI and machine learning algorithms are fundamentally mathematical entities, but can also be described using pseudocode , i.e. an informal high-level language that looks somewhat like computer code. In practice, of course, AI models can be implemented with any one of a range of modern programming languages. Today, various open-source libraries (such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Pytorch) make AI algorithms available through their standard application programming interface (API). Finally, an AI model is the output of an AI algorithm run on your training data. It represents the rules, numbers, and any other algorithm-specific data structures required to make predictions about unseen test data. The decision tree algorithm, for example, creates a model consisting of a tree of if-then statements, each one predicated on specific values. Meanwhile, deep neural network algorithms create a model consisting of a graph structure that contains many different vectors or weights with particular values.

The ability to detect PPE compliance has a lot of benefits especially reducing the risk of injury and lowering the cost of non-compliance. This means that Chooch AI brings immense value to its partners and customers. Chooch AI’s PPE detection models are pre-trained and ready for deployment. Often, they can be deployed within days because of the pre-training. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) detection ensures worker safety by protecting them against health and safety risks. When workers don’t wear PPE the risk of injury, contamination and financial losses due to fines go up. AI models that are trained to ensure safety equipment compliance, reduce the risk of injury and lower the cost of non-compliance while ensuring environmental health and safety. Chooch AI Models detect PPE compliance and automate safety in the workplace using the following method: AI models are trained to detect PPE Afterward, AI models process video streams with computer vision. When a lack of PPE compliance is detected, Chooch AI sends alerts and location data to stakeholders indicating that worker safety is at risk. PPE detection and compliance can benefit different facilities such as Warehouses, where there are safety risks such as falls and hard hats, are required. Factories where gloves, safety boots, safety goggles, and hairnets are required to avoid contamination or contact with hazardous material. Construction sites. Hospitals which require workers to wear gloves, masks, and gowns. Mining operations. After an AI model has been deployed successfully, it also receives remote training from Chooch AI. And when a partner has special needs, a custom model can be also be deployed. Learn more about how AI models for PPE detection and compliance and about Computer Vision for Security.

       "  'text': 'Computer Vision for PPE Compliance at Industrial Facilities | Chooch Certain employees will continually fail to use the PPE equipment and managers may never even notice. Tragically, this results in worsened injuries when an accident occurs. It also causes a host of accident-related costs and operational inefficiencies for businesses. Now, the latest computer vision technology is making PPE enforcement easier than ever — allowing industrial businesses to achieve near-100% PPE compliance while reducing the number and severity of accidents at industrial facilities. Why PPE Compliance Is Critical According to statistics from the International Labor Organization (ILO) , there are approximately 340 million work-related accidents globally each year, and 160 million people suffer from work-related illness. Of these, approximately 2.3 million people die of their injuries and illnesses. With specific regard to workplace accidents , the NYU protective equipment (PPE) standard reports that the vast majority of injuries could have been prevented with the use of appropriate PPE. For example, 70.9% of hand and arm injuries could have been prevented by using safety gloves, and 99% of face injury victims were not wearing facial protection. Costs and Consequences of Inadequate PPE Enforcement Accidents and injuries that result from inadequate PPE enforcement cause the following costs for industrial businesses: Additional accidents and more severe injuries when accidents occur. Greater dissatisfaction among workers due to a workplace culture that doesn’t emphasize worker safety. Reduced productivity due to job site shutdowns and labor shortages following an injurious accident. Higher insurance premiums following serious workplace accidents and OSHA violations. Increased litigation costs due to wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits, lawyer fees, settlements, and other liabilities. More safety citations and fees due to regulator inspections and safety infractions following injurious workplace accidents. Leveraging Computer Vision for Better PPE Compliance The latest computer vision technology can monitor PPE use across every inch of a property to help companies achieve near-100% PPE compliance . Most importantly, these visual AI systems radically reduce work-related injuries and their associated costs and consequences. By using a network of strategically placed, AI-equipped, high-definition cameras, industrial facilities can detect evidence of PPE non-compliance, and send a manager or foreman to educate and remind the employee on appropriate PPE use. The Chooch AI visual AI platform includes pre-made computer vision models—ready for immediate implementation—that detect PPE compliance failures related to: Hard hats Gloves Vests Eye protection Aprons Face shields Harnesses Virtually any type of PPE With Chooch AI, businesses can also train new visual AI models for unique PPE enforcement use cases. Beyond PPE enforcement alone, computer vision for PPE compliance provides a visual record of employees using required PPE. This data may be important in the event of a safety inspection or lawsuit following a serious workplace accident. Case Study: Theft and Safety Glove Inspections Recently, Chooch AI developed a computer vision solution for a nationwide automobile disassembly enterprise with over 400 industrial facilities throughout the United States. Hand-related accidents were the biggest source of workers’ compensation claims for the auto disassembler. Most of these injuries involved cuts, lacerations, and broken bones—and the vast majority could have been avoided by using safety gloves. The auto disassembler was experiencing the following costs and consequences related to hand injuries: Absenteeism and staffing shortages: Employees with hand injuries typically needed to miss 1 to 4 weeks of work. Financial losses: A typical hand injury claim could cost the company between $2,000 and $10,000. A culture of PPE non-compliance: The inability to enforce safety glove use had solidified into a culture of PPE non-compliance that was difficult to break. Chooch AI helped the auto disassembler train and implement a new AI model for PPE safety glove detection. With a simple update to their existing visual AI system for theft detection, Chooch uploaded a patch for safety glove detection across the company’s entire network of 400-plus facilities. Armed with the “eyes-on-the-backs-of-their-heads” solution they were looking for, the auto disassembler started to receive instant alerts of PPE non-compliance pertaining to safety gloves. This allowed managers and foremen to provide the appropriate safety training and coaching to employees. Chooch AI: Computer Vision for PPE Compliance Chooch AI offers enterprises the flexibility to deploy visual AI models for nearly any PPE compliance challenge. With its vast library of pre-built computer vision models, Chooch AI can identify employees that fail to wear gloves, hard hats, aprons, safety glasses, harnesses, and more. Best of all, Chooch AI is so fast and easy to use that businesses can train and deploy unique AI models in just 6 to 9 days. Faster response times: By simultaneously monitoring hundreds of surveillance camera feeds covering every inch of a property, computer vision offers real-time alerts for faster response times as soon as a problem occurs. Dramatically less expensive and more efficient: Working in conjunction with human security personnel, Chooch AI empowers security teams to boost the speed, accuracy, coverage, and cost-efficiency of security-related tasks. By partnering with a robotics provider, Chooch AI developed a computer vision strategy to augment the logistic company’s security coverage while reducing their staffing, training, and management burdens. By seamlessly integrating Chooch AI with drones and robotic “dogs,” the logistics company achieved more accurate monitoring for fence breaches, unauthorized personnel, and a host of premises-related security concerns – without the use of additional human capital and without incurring additional security expenditures.

       "  'text': 'Computer Vision Defect Detection | Chooch Imagine a manufacturing facility with a team of quality control inspectors that never get tired, never get distracted, and always perform their jobs with laser-point accuracy. Even better, these defect detection inspectors provide their services for a fraction of the usual cost. Until recently, this idea was nothing more than a pipedream. But today, global industrial manufacturers and consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies are deploying AI-based computer vision technologies to detect manufacturing defects. These AI systems are detecting flaws with levels of accuracy that far exceed the capacity of human inspectors – and they’re also a lot less expensive than human workers. In this article, we’ll look at why computer vision defect detection systems are needed in manufacturing facilities and how visual AI defect detection works. We’ll also discover some exciting real-world use cases for this technology in manufacturing and CPG facilities. The Need for Visual AI Defect Detection in Manufacturing Manufacturing and CPG defects can be costly. According to Marsh.com , product defects can trigger enormous costs and expenditures related to: Notifying retailers and customers about defective products Identifying and tracking down defective products Transporting and repackaging defective products Destroying and disposing of defective products Replacing defective products with better-built items free of defects Adverse publicity that damages the manufacturer’s reputation Loss of revenue that results from adverse publicity The cost of marketing and public relations efforts to rehabilitate sales and rebuild customer trust Of these expenditures, Allianz claims that “the biggest single cost of a product recall event is the loss of sales and business interruption, both from the recall itself and the reputational damage.” There is also the potential for legal costs related to defective product liability lawsuits . According to Allianz, “defective product incidents have caused insured losses in excess of $2 billion over the past five years, making them the largest generator of liability losses.” Considering these costs, the ROI benefits of catching defects before they leave the manufacturing facility is obvious. However, human defect inspectors can only do so much to identify manufacturing errors at industrial factories and CPG facilities. While most manufacturing facilities have a longstanding history of relying on human defect inspectors, humans employed in visual inspection tasks are prone to getting tired, distracted, and making serious and costly errors. This is where a visual AI quality control system can help. Visual AI systems for defect detection are not only more affordable than human defect detection staff, but they are also more accurate when it comes to finding and reporting defects. How Visual AI Defect Detection Works Modern Visual AI technologies rely on powerful cloud-based servers that allow them to rapidly ingest visual information for machine-learning training purposes. By training a computer vision system with hundreds of thousands or millions of images of specific types of product defects, these systems can learn to rapidly identify similar defects with a high degree of accuracy. Visual AI defect detection systems can identify flaws like bottles missing bottlecaps, cracks in pipelines, poorly painted surfaces, missing parts, broken items, misshaped items, cracked glass, cracked metal casings, and virtually any other type of errors that human visual inspectors identify. After setting up a high-quality camera system along the assembly line of a manufacturing facility – and connecting the cameras to the visual AI system – facilities can detect, flag, remove, and replace defective products more efficiently and successfully, thereby circumventing the massive costs and workflow inefficiencies that these errors cause. Best of all, this is achieved vastly more affordably than relying on human laborers. The most advanced visual AI inspection technologies – such as Chooch.com – can spawn lightweight “Edge AI” systems that run in the cloud. These systems can immediately integrate with an existing IoT infrastructure of cameras. They can also automatically deploy to the Edge through cloud-based dashboards and APIs. Finally, Edge AI technology makes the integration and replication of a trained visual AI defect detection system easier and more efficient across an entire enterprise. Use Case Examples for Visual AI Defect Detection in Manufacturing We have identified an endless range of visual AI defect detection use cases. These use cases apply to industrial manufacturing plants, CPG facilities, quality controls for infrastructure, airline industry safety, and more. Ultimately, whenever a manufacturing facility employs human laborers to visually inspect for defects, an AI-based computer vision system can likely perform the same task with greater efficiency and fewer errors. Here are several use case examples for a visual AI defect detection system: Industrial manufacturing plants: Industrial manufacturing facilities must meet specific levels of quality – not only because they must provide defect-free products to their customers, but also due to industry standards and government regulations. With a Chooch computer vision system , organizations can train a visual AI system to detect the most important defects that interfere with product quality at an industrial manufacturing plant. These could relate to cracks in casings, broken products, missing parts, unsightly scratches, dust on painted items, structural integrity problems, poorly painted items, and more. CPG production facilities: Consumer packaged goods manufacturers must meet some of the highest safety and quality standards that exist. Visual inspectors need to identify discolored potato chips, unsightly or rotten food products, packaging defects, and other defects. An appropriately trained Chooch.AI system can identify these kinds of defects –\\xa0 including blackened potato chips, misshapen food products, uncapped soft drinks, leaking products, broken glass, and poorly packaged items. Quality control for infrastructure: When it comes to the large machinery used in manufacturing – and essential infrastructure items required for mining, oil drilling, and other large-scale operations – visual AI systems can ensure that vital pieces of an operational infrastructure are free of problems and defects. For example, an IoT network of visual AI cameras can monitor oil pipelines and machinery for signs of stress and wear. These systems can also monitor an oil rig for safety-related problems, detecting them before a costly shutdown or dangerous accident occurs. Airline industry safety: Boeing reports that the airline industry spends approximately $40 billion per year on inspections and maintenance related to the safety and proper functioning of jets, engines, and other airline equipment. These expenditures relate to “the costs of the labor and materials required to perform servicing, repair, modification, restoration, inspection, test, and troubleshooting tasks during on-airplane and shop maintenance activities.” Visual AI defect detection systems – including drone-based visual AI systems – facilitate visual inspections related to airline equipment maintenance and safety. These systems offer a more cost-effective, accurate, and higher-quality means of detecting problems before they become unnecessarily dangerous or expensive. Here is a table that shows additional use case applications of visual AI defect detection in manufacturing: Use Cases for Defect Detection with Computer Vision Products Potential Defects Nonferrous Metals Wires, cables, aluminum, stainless steel Scratches, cracks, dirt, dents Building Materials Wood boards, sashes, metal fittings, tiles, other materials Scratches, cracks, surface defects, dents Electronic Parts Electronic materials, electronic components, circuit boards, electrical panels, other items Scratches, chips, cracks Auto Parts Material parts, resin parts, fabrics, other materials Scratches, dents, dirt, cracks Raw Materials Chemical fibers, rubber, glass, paper, pulp products Scratches, cracks, dirt, dents Food Processed foods, beverages, food packaging, bottling Foreign objects, labeling errors, leaks, packaging damage, missing bottlecaps Medical Pharmaceutical medicines, medical devices, surgical equipment, wound dressings, syringes, other items Foreign objects, labeling errors, cracks, defects, dirt, impurities, sanitary issues Build Your Visual AI Defect Detection System with Chooch.AI At Chooch.com , we design visual AI systems for virtually any industry and any application.

       "  'text': 'What is Edge Device? | Chooch The massive growth of IoT devices and its new applications is driving edge ai with an explosive increase in revenues expected to go from 2.8 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 to 9 billion by 2024. The rise of edge computing has been significantly transforming how organizations are collecting their data, processing it, and gaining insights for more data-driven business decisions. But, what is an edge device? What are edge devices? Edge computing is a distributed topology where data storage and processing are done close to the edge devices where it’s being collected, rather than relying on a central location that can be thousands of miles away. Edge devices are hardware components that control data flow at the boundary between two networks where they serve as network entry (or exit) points. Enterprises and service providers use edge devices for transmitting, routing, processing, monitoring, filtering, translating, and storing data passing between networks. Examples of edge devices include cameras, sensors, routers, integrated access devices, multiplexers, and a variety of metropolitan area network and wide area network access devices. What are benefits of running inferencing on edge devices? Speed and Latency Analyzing data, especially real-time data, in edge devices, eliminates latency issues that can affect performance. The less time it takes to analyze data, the more value that comes from it. For example, when it comes to autonomous vehicles, time is of the essence, and most of the data it gathers and processes is useless after a couple of seconds. Enhanced Security The distributed architecture that comes with edge computing enables organizations to distribute security risks as well, which diminishes the impact of attacks on the organization as a whole. Edge computing enables organizations to overcome local compliance and privacy regulations’ issues, as well. Cost Savings Edge computing helps companies to reduce costs associated with transporting, managing, and securing data. By keeping data within your edge locations, you optimize bandwidth usage to connect all of your locations. Reliability Business operations continuity may require local processing of data to avoid possible network outages. Storing and processing data in edge devices improves reliability, and temporary disruptions in network connectivity won’t impact the devices’ operations. How do edge devices work? Edge devices have a very simple working principle; it serves as network entry or exit and connects two different networks by translating one protocol into another. Moreover, it creates a secure connection with the cloud. An edge device is a plug-and-play; its setup is quick and straightforward. It is configured via local access and also has a port to connect it to the internet and the cloud. How do edge devices offer a better AI experience? Many Artificial intelligence use-cases are better done on edge devices, offering maximum availability, data security, reduced latency, and optimized costs. Running Machine learning models can be computationally expensive in cloud-based environments. Meanwhile, inference needs relatively low computing resources. When AI models are trained on the cloud, data needs to be transferred from end-devices to predict outputs. This needs a stable connection, and since the volume of data is large, the transfer can be slow or, in some cases, impossible. Edge AI moves algorithms closer to the data source where they’re processed locally without requiring any connection offering real-time analytics in less than few milliseconds The volumes of data are significantly increasing, so is the need to process it autonomously. Enabling Deep Learning algorithms to perform EdgeTraining locally is a must-have feature for many applications such as autonomous vehicles. IoT edge devices are now able to run machine learning models locally within the device using TensorFlow, Pytorch, or other machine learning tools. The thing that enables capabilities to be handled directly on a device. Localizing the data reduces the latency that results from sending the data to the cloud, and it enables more immediate insights generated by devices. Massive changes are initiated with Edge AI raising demand for IoT smart devices, and the emergence of more advanced technologies. As organizations are increasingly adopting Edge AI to make their operations better and enable real-time performance, the market will significantly grow to keep pace with the computing requirements of these smart items. How does Chooch use Edge AI to help businesses? Chooch Edge AI helps organizations to take their video analytics and IoT applications to the next level.

       "  'text': 'Training Computer Vision With Data Augmentation | Chooch Computer vision and artificial intelligence need a lot of data. The more volume and variety of data that you can show to your model during AI training, the more high-performance and robust the model will be when examining data in the real world that it hasn’t seen before. There’s just one issue: what if you only have a limited amount of data in the first place? That’s where data augmentation comes in. For example, suppose you want to train a computer vision model to recognize different cat breeds. To achieve the best results, your model should train on a balanced dataset that has roughly the same number of images for each breed. It should be easy enough to find thousands of images of the most popular breeds, such as Persians and Siamese cats, but what about extremely rare breeds such as the LaPerm or the Sokoke ? Without correcting this imbalance, your model can achieve a very high accuracy on the training data simply by learning to recognize the most popular (and therefore overrepresented) breeds. However, this strategy won’t do as well in the real world—for example, a breed recognition quiz that treats all breeds equally, with a single question about each one. Don’t have enough data to train your AI model ? No problem. Below, we’ll discuss a powerful strategy for computer vision to accomplish the (seemingly) impossible: augmenting 2D images. Data Augmentation for 2D Images Data augmentation is a useful technique for expanding the size of your dataset without having to find or generate new images. How is this possible? Suppose you have a single image of a cat that you want to augment within your dataset. The transformations that you can make to this image without changing the correct answer (e.g., “Persian” or “American Shorthair”) include: Flipping the image (horizontally or vertically) Rotating the image Scaling the image (e.g., zooming in or out) Cropping the image Placing the foreground object onto a new background Altering the hue of the image What are the benefits of augmenting 2D images for computer vision ? By slightly modifying the original image, you can create perhaps dozens of augmented images. This makes it harder for the AI model to overfit (i.e., learning to recognize the data itself instead of learning the underlying patterns and concepts). For example, a robust AI model for cat breeds should still be able to identify the correct breeds even when the original images are rotated to be upside down. How to Augment 2D Images with Chooch There’s just one question left: how can you perform 2D data augmentation for computer vision ? Without technical experts on hand, trying to build your own scripts and workflows might suck up valuable time that\\xa0you could instead spend fine-tuning the model and getting better results. Fortunately, there’s an answer to this question: powerful, user-friendly computer vision platforms like Chooch. With Chooch, you can augment your existing images in just a few clicks, performing various transformations to make your dataset more robust. Working in Chooch’s user-friendly dashboard, you can upload an annotated image of your choice, and then select the pre-built transformations and augmentations you want to perform. You can then deploy this model wherever you need it, including on edge devices . In order to generate the most useful augmented images, data augmentation in Chooch can only be performed on source images with bounding box annotations. The transformations available within the Chooch dashboard for data augmentation include: Shifting, scaling, and rotating Horizontally flipping Cutting out the background Adding noise and blurring Changing the brightness and contrast You can choose the default values for these transformations, or tweak and fine-tune the intensity of each augmentation yourself. You can also adjust the number of augmented images to be generated from each source image. Once you’ve adjusted the settings to your liking, Chooch will create the augmented dataset with just a click in a matter of seconds.

       "  'text': 'What is an AI Computer? | Chooch As the name suggests, an AI computer is any computing machine that can do\\xa0work in the field of\\xa0artificial intelligence. Thanks to the rapid pace of technological developments, even modest consumer hardware can today be considered an “AI computer,” capable of running cutting-edge ai models . The past few decades have seen tremendous strides in AI computing technology . In the 1980s and 1990s, for example, when computing power came at a premium, machines had to be specially built and configured to do AI work. Now, the average laptop has three of the most crucial components for any AI computer: Graphical processing unit (GPU): Originally\\xa0created for real-time computer graphics, the GPU excels at any task that requires massively parallel processing, including many types of AI models (such as deep learning). Central processing unit (CPU): Work that can’t be offloaded to the GPU on an AI computer is instead run on the CPU, which you can think of as the machine’s “brain.” But technological progress has made CPUs more and more powerful with a higher number of cores capable of handling many tasks that were previously GPU-exclusive. Software: The past decade has seen an explosion in the availability of AI and machine learning frameworks and software. Even relative beginners to programming can use these tools to spin up powerful AI models in just a few lines of code. The choice of operating system is also an important factor when building an AI computer: UNIX-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS are significantly more convenient for programmers, and many AI frameworks have been optimized for Linux versions such as Ubuntu and Red Hat. Windows computers can present compatibility issues with some AI tools, but the operating system itself is so widespread that it should always be taken into account. macOS is convenient in terms of software, but Macintosh hardware still lags behind\\xa0Linux and Windows when it comes to sheer power (although Apple has been trying to catch up by introducing new chips). How does AI computing software work? The dominant form of AI these days is deep learning, which uses an AI model known as the neural network. Machine learning engineers use deep learning software frameworks such as PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow to\\xa0build AI models\\xa0with just a few keystrokes, and then train them on the GPU. Composed of many interconnected nodes called “neurons” organized in multiple layers, neural networks are a rough simulation of the structure of the human brain. Each connection between two neurons has a corresponding weight, whose value determines the importance given that connection (larger values represent stronger connections). Neural networks are trained using an algorithm called backpropagation, that automatically adjusts the weights of the neural network when the model makes an incorrect prediction. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is a special form of neural network optimized for analyzing visual imagery, such as photographs and videos. AI platforms such as Chooch can process and interpret any kind of visual input, from X-rays and sonograms to video cameras and infrared satellite images.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have never been so widespread or so accessible to the masses – that’s why AI computers have become a thing.\\xa0To incorporate artificial intelligence into your own workflows, of course, you need an AI computer. In a 2020 report, the consulting firm McKinsey & Company found that half of organizations “have adopted AI in at least one function.” Also, businesses who derive the most value from AI report that they’ve experienced benefits such as better performance, higher growth rates, and stronger leadership.

       "  'text': 'Synthetic Data Webinar | Faster AI Model Generation | Chooch To build accurate computer vision models, you need data—and lots of it. Now, you can generate images with synthetic data and augmented data on the Chooch AI platform , and then use these synthetic images to train and deploy computer vision models. What you’ll learn in this webinar is how to use different technologies with the same goal: deploying accurate computer vision even faster. Watch the video or read the transcript below. Emrah Gultekin: So thank you all for joining in today. And what we’re going to do today, we’re going to run through a lot of material. And so if you have questions, you can ask them during or after the webinar. But basically, what we’re talking about today is synthetic data . And it’s a part of generating data so that you can train the AI. And so at the end of the day, what we’re talking about really is some of the inferencing that goes on, and the problem that you’re trying to solve. So let’s say you’re tasked to detect something and it’s not in a pre-trained model, there are no pre-trained classifications for it or if they are, they’re not really good. So at the end of the day, what you’re trying to do here is, you’re trying to generate better inferences. So this is where it all happens. And the inference or the prediction … You’re sending in video feed, or images and what’s happening is you’re getting responses for that. So it’s detecting simple things like cars and people, faces and so forth, very complex things like parts or scratches or types of cells, and so forth. So you can do a lot of stuff. So it really ends up here in inferencing. Which is important for us and important for the clients as well and also a part of all the ecosystem partners out there. But what’s happening is, if you go back to the cycle here, it really begins with data. So today, we’re going to be talking about these things and that is data generation to train a model. So it goes into here. And we’re not going to be talking about model training today but all of you who are on this call know something about this. But what you do is you create data, and then you train the model, then you do the inferencing. And the inferencing helps you create data again. So this is like a cycle here that goes back and forth. So today we’re going to be talking about data generation through a series of tools. This is not just synthetic data, you’ve got manual annotation, you’ve got smart annotation and data augmentation, so forth. So today we’re going to be talking clearly about this. The result is inferencing all the time, so increasing the accuracy, increasing the stability of the model and creating those dynamic models that we all dream of. So the question becomes, where do you get the data? So the data, you have public data sets, you’ve got client data sets, you can do web scraping and so forth. But at the end of the day, the issue has always been … And this is particular in visual detection, and that’s what we’re talking about today, the visual AI. In particular, what you’re seeing is that the models that you train, you need to have a lot of data. And this is like in the thousands of images per class. So where do you really get that data? There are ways to do it. You can scrape, you can get client data, you can get public datasets and so forth. But it’s usually not annotated, it’s unstructured. And it’s not enough. So that’s the question here is, where do you get it? And one way to do is to synthesize the data. And that’s what we’re going to talk about today is getting some base data, some real data and then synthesizing that to create diverse data sets in order to generate the data set necessary to train the model or train multiple models at the same time. So this is what this is about. And on our platform , you can do this but you can also import already generated data sets from somewhere else and generate the model. So you don’t really have to do it on our system, you can do it on a partner system, on another ecosystem partner who actually does this type of data set creations as well or if there are people who do annotation and so forth. So you can actually upload data sets that are already created somewhere else and then generate the model with one click basically. So the problem here is data sets require lots of labeled, high quality, and usually copyright free images. So that’s a lot of stuff and it’s very difficult to overcome that. And so in order to do this, your goal is to generate a computer vision model that can work in real environments. And this means you really need a lot of images in sufficient variation. This could be coming through video frames or it could be coming through images itself and whatnot, but you really need a substantial amount of them. And the data that you generate has to have a minimum of labeling errors. So it’s not enough to just have raw data, maybe having files that are labeled but you also need to annotate them, especially if you’re doing object detection. And this is a very slow process to do this manually and intrusive lots of errors and takes a long time. It’s not scalable, basically. So manual annotation, it’s necessary. You have to do that because that’s how you see the AI and you see the model, see the data set but it’s not scalable for a number of reasons. Humans are not scalable. So the conclusion is you generate synthetic images of the annotated objects to train a model and detect real world situation. So this is really what we’re doing here. So you need lots, labeled, it needs to be high quality. So the workflow and methodology we have here at Chooch AI is quite simple actually. You sculpt the problem with the client or with the partner. Basically what the case is, what is the client trying to detect? What are they trying to detect? And usually, the answer to this is not that simple. And sometimes you have to walk through with the client to understand what they’re actually trying to achieve with visual detection. You sculpt the case and basically on the technical side, you start to check the performance of the pre-trained models or existing models. So you want to be able to use a pre-trained models as much as possible to deploy a model or inference engine to the client. But you also have to understand that usually, these pre-trained models are not sufficient for production purposes unless they’re done for a specific purpose. Then what happens is you generate data. And basically what you’re doing is you’re reading this data to augment the data that already exists there or generate something from scratch. The best way to understand if your data set is good it to train a model and then test it. And then when you deploy it, you get feedback from the users and then that goes into the data set again. So it’s the cycle where you’re generating models which are dynamic. So if you’re just generating a model that’s static and you say this works out of the box for everything, that’s usually not the case. You need user feedback, you need different types of feedback to enhance the data set as you move forward. So this is a more extensive workflow here. But basically what it is, understand the available data in the detection requirements from the client. You generate the data for data gaps, that’s the second step of that, train and test the models. So you’re trying to increase the accuracy of the model. And that is the F1 score that we talk about which is a harmonized mean between precision and recall. You want to increase that. Then you deploy the models, receive feedback from users on correct, incorrect or unknown objects or maybe there’s something new that needs to be trained, you want to put a new class in. So you can receive that feedback directly from users annotated or not annotated. And put that feedback back into the data set and retrain the model. So you have that cycle there where the workflow is very crucial to the scalability of this entire system. So these are some of the tools that we use on our system, you have obviously manual data set labeling, you got smart annotation, 2D synthetic data, 3D synthetic data, data augmentation. So today, we’re going to be talking about these which are really related to data set generation, you go into model training and dense training, cloud inferencing, F1 score calculation, unknown object detection, user feedback and edge inferencing, device stream management. So you have this gamut that you need to be able to do to deploy at scale with clients. But today we’re going to be talking about these with which is synthetic data , and some of the annotation tools that we have. We have manual annotation, obviously very, very important. And then you have video annotation, which is annotating a video and then having the tracking system track that object throughout the video and generate a data set based on that, which generates hundreds of thousands of images through a video, basically. And then you have smart annotation with AI, which is using the inference engine, again, to annotate new data. So this is part of that cycle where you need the inference engine to do the annotation work. And so our core is the inference engine as a company. So we’ve focused totally on that. And it’s important to understand that really closes the loop on the dynamic model creation cycle. Data augmentation is also very important here. And then you have synthetic 2D data and then synthetic 3D data. So we’re going to go through these today. So manual annotation is very straightforward. It’s pretty much people drawing bounding boxes or polygons around objects. It’s a painstaking process and it requires training, and it’s not very skilled. But actually it’s a very important part of this because if you don’t have the manual annotation, you can’t really teach the AI new things and increase their accuracy of the inference engine. So even if you have a machine annotating, it is really based on the human who annotated initially that data set to train the model to do the inferencing for the annotation. So it’s a very important part of this process. And this is a basic thing from our dashboard. You have the … Basically just growing bounding boxes around it and you can label it whatever you want. And you continue doing this through the entire data set. And then you have these different classes over here, which will show up as you annotate. And this is part of that. So you see the entire gamut of images that are produced in that data set. And you can see a video over here as well which is actually part of this. And then you can see here that you have synthetic data , you have smart annotation, and you have augmentation as well. And you can add images to this data set and whatnot. The video annotation is also very important because it allows you to scale the amount of frames that are being put into the data set. And this is an important tool, especially if you’re doing something very specific for a specific task, it actually tracks that entire object, unknown object it tracks unknown object, unknown action through the life cycle, through that video, and then generates images into that data set. So this is a conveyor, uploading this … It’s just an MP4 video. And basically, what you do is you click on it, and you start annotating. And you can choose which area of the video you want to annotate. You’ve got an orange part here, and then you’ve got a blue part, and basically you click on annotate process and it’s processing it. And it’ll just follow these through the video and generate a data set for it. So you do once and it’s already generated like 80 images each of that. So this is a very important tool especially if you’re doing something very specific in a specific field or you have lots of video and you want to annotate it. And then you generate this data set for you. Another powerful tool or smart annotation. And this is something that we launched a few months ago. And basically what it is, is you’re using the inference engine to annotate already known objects. And these give a pre trained by our system or can be pre-trained by the user, by the enterprise who’s already using the system. And you can use your custom object models, or you can use basically pre-trained Chooch object models as well. And it automatically annotates entire image data without manual labeling. So it’ll annotate everything and then you can review the annotation done by the machine. This is a very important tool, again, the inference engine. Inference engine has to be very strong to be able to do these types of things. So we got some spark plugs here. You click on the smart annotation, and you press my object models, press a spark plug and you press start and these are unannotated, these images, and what basically happens is when you press start on this, it automatically annotates everything in the data set with the spark plug. And then you can use that to train the model. So you’re actually … What you’re doing is you’re constantly building a data set, automating the building of the data set through these tools in order to train the model as you move forward. Data augmentation as well is very, very important. And this is something that’s done on the back end of some of the already existing deep learning frameworks. But what you really want to do is be able to tune it, if you’re a power user. And so in some instances, your data … Even if you have a lot of data, it’s still not enough to train the model because it doesn’t have the right views or there’s not enough noise and so forth. So you want to be able to do data augmentation here and to do it on the system as well. It helps generalize the existing data set basically. So we have a part data set here, it’s part of the spark plug. And then what you’re basically doing is upload … Let’s say you have these five images of these different things, and they’re annotated and you annotate them basically. And then you have these images here with the different parts, press augmentation and you can … This is over here and press the augmentation thing and it pops this up. And you can go up to 100 iterations, we don’t recommend that, we recommend three or four X the amount, it just over fits but you can play around with it basically. So it’s rotation, horizontal flip, cut out, shifting, scaling, basic things that you do and there are default settings here but if you want to play around with it, you can do that. That’s fine. And scaling, rotation, noise, blur, brightness, contrast, and you start the augmentation on the entire data set basically, randomize it … Based on randomization principle and then it generates all this. So you’ve got 1000 of each here, which is a lot. And then you can use that to train the data set basically. You can see here that this is quite different from the original one, that’s flipping around, changing the noise, changing the lighting, and coloring and all that. Another tool, which is very, very important is the 2D synthetic data. It’s almost like a combination of augmentation and synthetic data. It’s a lot of augmentation, actually. But what you’re basically doing is you’re creating bounding box free transformations, and it’s auto background removal. So when you annotate something, it segments that out and places in different environments basically, and that’s what this is about. Rotates it, flips it around, does a lot of different distancing, and then creates that data set for it. And it’s all randomized and that’s basically part of this process. So we go back to a part data set here. And this is the same part. So I have a quick release part here. And I want to create a 2D of this. And I’m creating another thousand maxim object count per image. And you can choose the different themes that you have. You can use your themes, or you can use our themes. And this is basically just background. So based on what that environment is, it could be the sky, it could be industrial and so forth. And you choose the raw data here, conveyor belt, background and they’re generated. So I’ve got a conveyor belt background here, I generate that and basically it generates all these images with these parts on conveyor belt. And these may not look that realistic but it’s good enough for the randomization of the data set. And that’s what you’re trying to do. Randomize the data set so that it creates a more robust model. So we can move on to 3D synthetic data , which is also important. But it’s important to understand that not all companies have CAD files. And this is a requirement for 3D synthetic data, you need to have a object file and the material file. So it’s textures and the object, and you just basically upload it. And it’s similar to the 2D that you choose a background theme and number of images and it generates it with the bounding boxes inside of it. Let’s do this in 3D data set. So you can see here it’s ATR 42 object. And then it looks like this, you rotate around and do what you need to do with it. And basically, what you’re doing is how many images do you want to generate, press … You have advanced settings here for power users, and that’s like gray scale, in object files as well. You can take out and randomize that and then basically press choose themes or your own theme, and then this is in the air so it’s sky. And then basically say generate. And it’ll generate these and all you have is you get this data set where you have 3000 images of the ATR 42. And then these are some of the sample images that come out. So again, these are semi-realistic but good enough for the data set to be generated to train the model. And that’s what this is really about. Normally best practice is always to use real data to augment any type of synthetic data and vice versa. So if you do have real data, it’s important to have that as context because things may be out of context as well. So it’s important to generate these together at the same time. So what’s the result here. I mean, why are we doing this? This is I. Very well. It’s higher F1 scores, higher accuracy and dynamic models. So model drift, you’ve got problems with accuracy, and you need that feedback and data set to generate constantly higher F1 scores. So here, what you can’t do on the system is you can upload a data set, that’s what we’re going to do, a test data set, parts testing data set. You upload the entire data set which is already annotated. And it’ll start generating F1 and then give you that score. So in order to make this a very quick process of understanding how that model actually is delivered and is being used and what the accuracy is, you need to be able to have this test data set. And then you get the different types of F1 scores here based on that. We usually recommend deploying after 90, you can deploy on production. Anything below 90, it depends on the use case but can be problematic. So you can see that here and then automatically deploy on any of the devices that you might have or just use the API cloud. So we can go on to questions now and I will just stop sharing this. Actually I’ll keep sharing because I might refer back to it. Yeah. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. Thanks, Emrah. That was a pretty complete overview of how we generate data. So we do have a few questions. For the benefit of those who don’t know, please explain why should we use synthetic data? I think we’ve answered that. Emrah Gultekin: Let me get into detail on these questions because this is quite important. You don’t have to. Synthetic data is not a must for everything, it’s a tool. It’s a component of something to do if you choose to do that, depending on how much data you already have. If you do have real data, that’s always better. But from our experience in the market, it’s very difficult to come across that and synthesize that data. I’ll give you an example from text recognition. So text detection, text recognition, it would not exist today without synthetic data. That stuff is all synthetic, understanding texts in the natural environment. So we believe that’s going to be the case with object detection and image classification as well. But it’s not a must to be able to train a model, you don’t need it to train a model but these are just tools to help. And again, there are companies that we partner with that generate synthetic data as well, or do annotation work. And you can upload those into the system and train the model. Our core as a company has always been the inference engine. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, the next question, is it possible to try the synthetic data generation tool before committing to a trial in the system? Emrah Gultekin: Oh, yes it is. So just get in touch with us. We’ll upgrade you to enterprise for a trial without a fee basically, so you can use it. It’s out of the box. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. It just requires that you … For the 3D synthetic generation, as Emrah said, you need a CAD file to make that go. Emrah Gultekin: CAD and material file, yeah texture. If you don’t have the MTL File, the textures won’t be randomized basically. Jeffrey Goldsmith: So is this a web based tool or does require local scripting coding and Docker deployment? Emrah Gultekin: So this is a web based tool. And it all resides on the cloud. So you can basically log in from anywhere and use it. So the annotation tools and some of the synthetic tools, that’s all web based. And the inferencing is also web based, unless you want the inference engine deployed on the edge or on-prem and you can do that through the system as well. So you can set up a device like any of the Nvidia GPUs, even the Jetson devices and then pull the Docker and have the inferencing run on the edge as well. But yeah, you can use it on the cloud. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. And you can sign up today in the upper right corner of the website and start using it. We have a question. What challenges have you seen in using 3D synthetic data? Challenges, Emrah? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so 3D synthetic data or 2D synthetic data, it’s not a panacea. It’s not going to solve all your problems, it’s not going to … And so the issue has been the expectations of the market. And the 3D synthetic data in particular is harder to come by because it requires a 3D model of that particular object. And so that usually … If you’re a manufacturer of that object, you probably have it. But outside of that, you’re not going to get a 3D model unless you work with let’s say, a 3D model designing company that can generate those. But that’s been the challenge with 3D is just getting the CAD and the texture files ready. And that’s something that is overcome by some of the clients that we work with. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, the next question is quite important. I suppose this person missed the beginning of the presentation. Can we create models using Chooch or just generate data? And the answer is yes. The point of creating data is to generate models. So we generate data, we create models, and then we do inferencing, the whole life cycle is there it at Chooch AI . Emrah Gultekin: So the whole point of generating the data is to create a model. And so you can do that on the system as well. We can go into more detail on that on another webinar. But basically, our whole thing has been the inference engine, which is the model itself. And by the way, to test the data set, the best thing to do is to train it because you’re never going to be able to test it otherwise properly. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Right. And that leads us into our next question, which is, could you give a more intuitive explanation of what an F1 score is? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. So F1 it’s what data scientists like to use but it’s basically another … It’s a fancy name for accuracy. So accuracy is made up of two things. It’s basically precision, which you would say false positive. So is this an airplane? If it says it’s a helicopter, that’s a false positive. And then you have recall, where it should have detected something but it didn’t. And that would be a false negative. So it’s basically just an average of those two. It’s just a fancy name for accuracy. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. We are getting some questions in chat too. So I employ you to enter your questions in the Q&A, but we’ll get to the chat questions after we’re done with the Q&A. Let’s see here. Any recommendations on how much synthetic versus real data is needed for a successful computer vision model batch size? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. We can talk about our system where you create the models, we recommend a minimum of 1000 images per class. And so that would be … Depending on the use case that you’re doing, real data, you want to have at a minimum of 100, 150. So about 10 to 15% of that. And then you can generate some 2D on that and some data augmentation. 3D is a separate deal. You can generate more on that and there are different types of best practices for that. But you want to get to about 1000 images. How you get to there, that’s up to you. You can use synthetic, you can use … If you have real, that’s always better. But a minimum of 1000 and then just keep going up from 1000 for production purposes. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay. Do you support deployment on mobile? We actually have a mobile app. But I really want to … Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so the deployment on a mobile is through an API. So we’ll be hitting the cloud. If you’re talking about the models being deployed on mobile, we don’t do that at the moment. But we do deploy on Nvidia Jetson devices, also Intel CPUs as well. But in terms of the mobile apps, it’s traditionally been just API call on the cloud. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah, we actually have a mobile app if you search in any app store for Chooch IC2. You can install it on your phone and try it. It basically sends screen grabs from your video feed to the cloud and it sends back metadata. It’s pretty cool, actually. So next question, how important is it to train the data with different backgrounds? Can we load our own backgrounds with different conditions and lightings to train? There we go. Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, it’s a good question. So we have some preset backgrounds that you can use. But usually what happens is the client has their own warehouse or manufacturing area, then they can load up that background as well. And so you can use that background to synthesize your data as well. So that’s under my themes. And basically, you just … You can upload to a data set itself or you can upload to raw data, and just pull that in when you click onto my themes. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, great question. What if my data is sensitive and cannot go out of my company? Is it possible to deploy it on company servers? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so this is a great question. And what we’re doing is we have … The inference engine is Dockerized. And you can deploy the inference engine on prem, which means none of that video inferencing or image inferencing will leave your device or your on prem installation. For the entire system, we’re working on Dockerizing that, including the training system and the data generation system, and we have clients who are waiting for that actually. It’s quite important. So we’re going to have that out by the end of the summer where you can basically take it and use it anywhere you want on any of the servers. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. And the next question is a comment. We need a webinar on model creation. Well, I’m sure we’ll publish one on that very soon. Is there an advantage to using a tight bounding polygon over a simple bounding box, advantages of background removal? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, that’s a very good question. So depending on your use case, bounding box or polygon, you’re going to choose between the two basically. And data scientists know which ones work for what. For 90% of use cases that we do, bounding box is fine. But even the bounding box itself, it actually segments that piece out. And that’s how the 2D generation is generated. So background removal is crucial. You cannot do background removal without polygon segmentation. And that’s how the 2D synthetic works. But in terms of inferencing and creating data set, bounding boxes are usually enough for generic deployments. We have sensitive deployment like satellite imagery or radiology, you definitely need polygon. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yep. We already answered to some degree, perhaps you’re getting to dive into this a little bit. Do you support edge inferencing? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, we support edge inferencing. The inference engine is exportable into the GPU devices and also Intel devices. And it’s basically a Docker that you pull and it gets set up within half an hour. And you can put models onto it, you can do updates, you can erase models, you can visualize the inferencing on it. So yes, edge inferencing is a crucial part of this whole system because if you don’t have edge inferencing, it’s virtually impossible to scale video in the long run. Jeffrey Goldsmith: And we’ve actually got documentation on how to deploy to the edge on our website, under the products section at the bottom. There’s a few different help documents. Next, synthetic data looks different. How can we know it will perform well? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so it looks different and you’re going to have to iterate on it. And that’s what we do as well. And the way to iterate is you create a model, basically. And you create the model on the system and see how it performs, test it on the system that you’ve created the synthetic data on, it’s basically all together. So you’re right, you need to iterate on these. It’s not going to perform well the first time. It’ll perform … Depends on the use case, obviously but usually it takes us about four to five iterations to get to a model that is production ready. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Pretty technical question here. Do you use GANs or VAEs to create synthetic data? Emrah Gultekin: This is a good question. And we are not using GANs or VAEs to create yet, but we’re using randomization. I think some our ML engineers can answer this much better. But basically, we’re in the process of putting GANs into the system, though, as we speak. It’s a good question. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Here’s a pretty good on thought leadership question, what impact will synthetic data generation have on the future of computer vision? Emrah Gultekin: It’s going to be a … So think of it this way, you do have a lot of data out there. But it’s unstructured. And our duty as people in the computer vision industry or AI and generalist is to structure that data. So the way you structure data is by seeding it through the inference engine in order to detect things. So the impact it will have on computer vision is enormous in terms of getting the models out and having different types of models. We think it is. Synthetic data is very, very important. But again, it’s a tool. It’s not the end all in this. So we don’t want to overemphasize something. It is an important tool but it is part of a larger thing that’s going on in computer vision. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Is the background combined with data and synthesized? I’m not quite sure I understand the question there. Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. I think I do but maybe I’m wrong. So in 3D synthetic data, you have the object file, the CAD file, the material file, MTL and then you choose a background as well. So you choose the background images. It could be an already generated theme on the system that we have or it could be your own theme. So it is synthesizing randomize with those backgrounds. So the background is not synthesized. The background is what you put into the system. So you might have like 2000 images of background of your warehouse and that’s where you’re going to be placing those different objects. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay. The last question in Q&A and then we’ll move over to the chat. Can you please explain using randomization for synthetic data generation? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. So in terms of randomization, you have different tools here that you are able to … There are toggle switches basically. So if you’re a power user, you can randomize the way you want and basically, place things in the places you want or you just use general randomization. And it’s on a randomization principle, where you can basically just let the machine randomize what it’s doing. But what’s important here is if you are a power user, you want to be able to control that randomization. And so you have those toggle switches in advanced settings to do that. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Emrah, are there any particular verticals that … E.g manufacturing where you see more adoption of synthetic data? Emrah Gultekin: Honestly, the clients don’t care about the use of synthetic data or real data, or what type of data you’re generating. What they really care about is how the model performs out of the box, how the model performs in their environment. So what we’re seeing more and more though is that the synthetic data is being used more in certain verticals where there’s a lack of data or lack of structured data, and manufacturing is one of them actually. But we’re seeing it more in geospatial. Jeffrey Goldsmith: We keep getting questions, which is fine, we still have some time here. How can you generate, for example, a partially covered stop sign with automated labeling? I mean … Emrah Gultekin: It’s a good question. And so this goes into CGI really and it is a universe unto itself. So you need a CGI person to create that base data to generate that. [crosstalk 00:54:46]. So you generate one of them and then basically the system randomize the rest. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Exactly. Is it possible to train them on like … We answered this to some degree but is it possible to train the model and export it in order run it without Chooch? Emrah Gultekin: This is a good question because what happens is these models that you see on the Chooch system are not really single models. They’re always ensembles, and they’re encoded with information from the past, from the purpose that it has already generated over the years. So it’s not possible to do it without the Chooch system on prem or on a device, but you’re able to export the system as well. So you can export the system to wherever you want to, but you can’t take these models out of a vacuum and have them perform. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Let’s see here, could you say which one works better, training the model with synthetic data entirely and later fine tuning the model with real data or training the model with a hybrid data, synthetic data and real data? Depends on the use case. Emrah Gultekin: So it’s always better to have real data, that is key. It’s always important to have that. The more real data you have, the better your model’s going to perform in the long run. But if you don’t have real data, you need to synthesize it. And that’s where the synthetic data comes into play. So if you do have real data, it’s important to have that with the data set that you’re basically trying to train. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. Last question … Oh, there’s even one more in the Q&A. They keep coming. So I want to share the preset with coworkers. Where can I find the video link? I’ll post it on our blog tomorrow, sometime in the afternoon but it’ll also be automatically sent to everyone who signed up for the Zoom webinar and on LinkedIn as well. Let’s see. Does Chooch work with all the major public cloud vendors, AWS, Azure, IBM, etc? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so currently we’re on AWS. And we’re looking into some of the others yet so that … The Dockerization of the entire system is important for us as a milestone. So once we have it Dockerized, you can basically take it anywhere. You don’t even have to contact us. It could work on private cloud, on prem and so forth. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, so let’s move to the chat here. First question is, is it a web service? And the answer is yes. If you go to Chooch.ai, go up to the upper right corner of the screen and sign up and you’ll see our web service right there. The second question, OpenVINO needs pre-trained models, correct? So perhaps your solution is more adequate for TensorFlow training. Does that make sense? Look at the chat. Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. Okay. The backend of this is PyTorch, Balloon, TensorFlow, TensorRT for the compression and so forth. These deep learning frameworks, some of them perform better in different environments. So it’s always an ensemble on our system. But TensorFlow is definitely one of them. So we do use TensorFlow for some of the image classification. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Another question from the same attendee, your platform is only used to generate training data sets and annotations or do you put together object AI recognition applications too? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. That’s a good question. So our core is actually the inferencing. So the models arc is our core. These are only tools to beef up the data set in order to make the model better. So, that’s really what this is about. But the core is the model. So you just click create model, and you click the data set that you’ve generated and it’ll just generate that model, and then you can test the model on the same system. Jeffrey Goldsmith: And we’re almost done with the questions here and we’re 10 minutes before the top of the hour. Does your system handle domain adaptation? Domain adaptation. Do you see that question, Emrah? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, I don’t understand the question. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. Matthew, could you rephrase that potentially, if you’re still on the call and we’ll answer that in a moment. How much accuracy increased going from 2D to 3D synthetic? Emrah Gultekin: So we can say, in general, depending on how much data you have, from real data manual data, which you might have 100 images of and then you create 2D let’s say with augmentation, 1000 images, you’re going from 50% accuracy to about 90% on average. But it really depends on the use case. From 2D to 3D, there’s no comparison because it’s a different thing. 3D synthetic data is very, very different. So we don’t have metrics on that. But from going from real data to any type of synthetic with augmentation, you’re basically reducing the accuracy by leaps and bounds. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, looks like this our last question. Usually, 2D image, object detection is feasible. What about 3D image object recognition? Where are we on that? Emrah Gultekin: We don’t do 3D object detection or recognition. It’s 2D. And the reason is because the market … All the sensors are 2D, all the cameras are … It’s an important question and we see a future on that. But the current market is all 2D. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay. Well, thank you everyone for your questions. Oops, there’s one more. Hi, in my experience, that question about domain adaptation, isn’t it a sub discipline of machine learning which deals with scenarios in which a model train on a source distribution is used in the context of a different but related target distribution? Emrah Gultekin: Right, okay, so you’re talking about the domain in that sense? Yeah. If the domain is changing and you have … Let’s say the views are changing, the domain is changing, usually you need to tweak the model. And that’s part of the process of creating a dynamic user feedback for a grift. That’s really what this is about. So if you go back to the earlier slides where you’re getting new user feedback with annotated or with just raw images or video streams, with a change in domain, you’ve put that into shadow data sets which are checked by humans and checked by a machine. And then either you retrain the model, or you create a new model if the domain is very, very different. So there are few layers that are going on to trigger different models, depending on the scene and on the domain. Jeffrey Goldsmith: So second last question. If anybody has anything else, please post it now. So what kind of support do you have for transfer learning? Transfer- Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. So the whole system is based on transfer learning actually, that’s how we’ve generated these models and these classifications as well. So it’s based on transfer learning from a base data set that we’ve trained initially, and we keep retraining that as well. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, great. Well, I think we are done here. Thanks for the talk. Can you share the recording with us? Absolutely, I can share the recording with you. It’ll be on the blog tomorrow. You’ll get notified by Zoom. Look for a link on the LinkedIn invite for the event and we’ll post it there. Emrah, thanks for the presentation. It was really well done. And thanks to the team for all your hard work putting together this technology. Please get in touch with us if you want any one on one support. And we’ll talk to y’all soon. Emrah Gultekin: Thank you very much, everybody. Learn more about computer vision with synthetic data . Share Featured Articles Edge AI When is the Right Time to Deploy Edge Computing?

       "  'text': 'Computer Vision Definitions | Chooch Learn more about computer vision and AI with this short list of top-level computer vision and AI terminology. Don’t know what AI training is? An AI model? Image recognition? What is an edge device? Find out from these quick computer vision definitions. Action recognition: A subfield of computer vision that seeks to identify when a person is performing an action, such as running, sleeping, or falling. AI API : An application programming interface (API) for users to gain access to artificial intelligence tools and functionality. By offering third-party AI services, AI APIs\\xa0save developers from having to build their own AI in-house. AI computer : Any computer that can perform computations for artificial intelligence and machine learning, i.e. performing AI training and running AI models. Thanks to recent technological advances, even modest consumer-grade hardware is now capable of being an AI computer, equipped with a powerful CPU and GPU. AI demo : A demonstration of the features and capabilities of an AI platform, or of artificial intelligence\\xa0in general. AI model : The result of training an AI algorithm, given the input data and settings (known as “hyperparameters”). An AI model is a distilled representation that attempts to encapsulate everything that the AI algorithm has learned during the training process. AI models can be shared and reused on new data for use in\\xa0real-world environments. AI platform : A software library or framework for users to build, deploy, and manage applications that leverage artificial intelligence. AI platforms are less static and more extensive than AI APIs: whereas AI APIs return the results of a third-party pre-trained model, AI platforms allow users to create their own AI models for different purposes. AI training : The process of training one or more AI models. During the training process, AI models “learn” over time by looking at more and more input data. After making a prediction about a given input, the AI model discovers whether its prediction was correct; if it was incorrect, it adjusts its parameters to account for the error. Algorithm: A well-defined, step-by-step procedure that can be implemented by a computer. Algorithms must eventually terminate and are used to perform a particular task or provide the answer to a certain problem. Annotation: The process of\\xa0labeling the input data in preparation for AI training. In computer vision , the input images and video must be annotated according to the task you want the AI model to perform. For example, if you want the model to perform image segmentation, the annotations must include the location and shape of each object in the image. Anomaly detection : A subfield of AI, machine learning , and data analysis that seeks to identify anomalies or outliers in a given\\xa0dataset. Anomaly detection is applicable across a wide range of industries and use cases: for example, it can help discover instances of bank fraud or defects in manufacturing equipment. Artificial general intelligence (AGI): A type of artificial intelligence that can accomplish a wide variety of tasks as well as, or even better than, human beings. So far, attempts to build an AGI have been unsuccessful. Artificial intelligence (AI) : A field of computer science that seeks to bring intelligence to machines, usually by simulating human thought and action. AI enables computers to learn from experience and adjust to unseen inputs. Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) : The intersection of artificial intelligence with the Internet of Things: a vast, interconnected network of devices and sensors that communicate and exchange information via the Internet. Data collected by IoT devices is then processed by AI models. Common AIoT use cases include wearable technology and smart home devices. Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI): A type of artificial intelligence that, in contrast with an AGI, is designed to focus on a singular or limited task (e.g., playing chess or classifying photos of dog breeds). Artificial neural network (ANN): Also, just called a “neural network,” a machine learning model that consists of many interconnected artificial “neurons.” These neurons exchange information, roughly simulating the human brain. ANNs are the foundation of deep learning, a subfield of machine learning. Backpropagation: The main technique by which ANNs learn. In backpropagation, the weights of the connections between neurons are modified via gradient descent so that the network will give an output closer to the expected result. Bayesian network: A probabilistic model in the form of a graph that defines the conditional probability of different events (e.g., the probability of event A happening, given that event B does or does not happen). Big data: The use of datasets that are too large and/or complex to be analyzed by humans or traditional data processing methods. Big data may present challenges in terms of velocity (i.e., the speed at which it arrives) or veracity (i.e. maintaining high data quality). Chatbot: A computer program that uses natural language processing methods to conduct realistic conversations with human beings. Chatbots are frequently used in fields such as customer support (e.g., answering simple questions or processing item returns). Computer vision : A subfield of computer science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning that seeks to give computers a rapid, high-level understanding of images and videos, “seeing” them in the same way that human beings do. In recent years, computer vision has made great strides in accuracy and speed, thanks to deep learning and neural networks. Computer vision platform : An IT solution for building and deploying computer vision applications, bundling together a software development environment with a set of associated computer vision resources. Computer vision solution : A tool or platform that helps users integrate computer vision into their workflows, even without in-depth\\xa0knowledge of computer vision or AI. Thanks to the wide range of applications for computer vision, from healthcare and retail to manufacturing and security, businesses of all sizes and industries are increasingly adopting computer vision solutions. Convolutional neural network (CNN): A special type of neural network that uses a mathematical operation known as a “convolution” to combine inputs (e.g., nearby pixels in an image). CNNs excel at higher-dimensional input such as images and videos. Data augmentation : A technique to increase the size of your datasets by making slight modifications to the existing images in the dataset. For example, you can rotate, flip, scale, crop, or shift an image in multiple ways to create dozens of augmented images. Incorporating augmented data can help the model learn to generalize better instead of overfitting to recognize the images themselves. Data collection : The process of\\xa0accumulating large quantities of information for use in\\xa0training an AI model. Data can be collected from proprietary sources (e.g. your own videos) or from publicly available datasets, such as the ImageNet database. Once collected, data must be annotated or tagged for use in\\xa0AI training. Data mining: The use of automated techniques to uncover hidden patterns and insights in a dataset and make smarter data-driven predictions and forecasts. Data mining is widely used in fields such as marketing, finance, retail, and science. Deep learning: A subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple “hidden” (deep) layers. Thanks to both algorithmic improvements and technological advancements, recent years have seen deep learning successfully used to train AI models that\\xa0can perform many advanced human-like tasks—from recognizing speech to identifying the contents of an image. D efect detection : A subfield of computer vision that seeks to identify defects, errors, anomalies, and issues with products or machinery. Dense classification: A method for training deep neural networks from only a few examples, first proposed in the 2019 academic paper “Dense Classification and Implanting for Few-Shot Learning” by Lifchitz et al. Broadly, dense classification encourages the network to look at all aspects of the object it seeks to identify, rather than focusing on only a few details. Digital ecosystem: An interconnected collection of IT resources (such as software applications, platforms, and hardware) owned by a given organization, acting as a unit to help the business accomplish its goals. Edge AI : The use of AI and machine learning algorithms running on edge devices to process data on local hardware, rather than uploading it to the cloud. Perhaps the greatest benefit of Edge AI is faster speeds (since data does not have to be sent to and from the cloud back and forth), enabling real-time decision-making. Edge device : An Internet-connected hardware device that is part of the Internet of Things (IoT) and acts as a gateway in the IoT network: on one hand, the local sensors and devices that collect data; on the other, the full capability of IoT in the cloud. For fastest results, many edge devices are capable of performing computations locally, rather than offloading this responsibility to the cloud. Edge platform : An IT software development environment that simplifies the process of deploying and maintaining edge devices. Ensemble learning: The use of predictions from multiple AI models trained on the same input (or samples of the same input) to reduce error and increase accuracy. Due to natural variability during the training phase, different models may return different results given the same data. Ensemble learning combines the predictions of all these models (e.g. by taking a majority vote) with the goal of improving performance. Event detection: A subfield of computer vision that analyzes visual data (i.e. images or videos) in order to detect when an event has occurred. Event detection has been applied\\xa0successfully to use cases such as fall detection and smoke and fire detection. Facial authentication : A subfield of facial recognition that seeks to verify a person’s identity, usually for security\\xa0purposes. Facial authentication is often performed on edge devices that are powerful enough to identify a subject almost instantaneously and with a high degree of accuracy. Facial recognition : The use of human faces as a biometric characteristic by examining various facial features (e.g. the distance and location of the eyes, nose, mouth, and cheekbones). Facial recognition is used both for facial authentication (identifying individual people with their consent) as well as in video surveillance systems that capture people’s images in public. Generative adversarial network (GAN): A type of neural network that attempts to learn through competition. One network, the “generator,” attempts to create realistic imitations of the training data (e.g., photos of human faces). The other network, the “discriminator,” attempts to separate the real examples from the fake ones. Genetic algorithm: A class of algorithms that takes inspiration from the evolutionary phenomenon of natural selection. Genetic algorithms start with a “pool” of possible solutions that evolve and mutate over time until reaching a stopping point. GPU: Short for “graphics processing unit,” a specialized hardware device used in computers, smartphones, and embedded systems originally built for real-time computer graphics rendering. However, the ability of GPUs to efficiently process many inputs in parallel has made them useful for a wide range of applications—including training AI models. Hash: The result of a mathematical function known as a “hash function” that converts arbitrary data into a unique (or nearly unique) numerical output. In facial authentication, for example, a complex hash function encodes the identifying characteristics of a user’s face and returns a numerical result. When a user attempts to access the system, their face is rehashed and compared with existing hashes to verify their identity. Image enrichment: The use of AI and machine learning to perform automatic “enrichment” of visual data, such as images and videos, by adding metadata (e.g. an image’s author, date of creation, or contents). In the media industry, for example, image enrichment is used to quickly and accurately tag online retail listings or new agency photos. Image quality control: The use of AI and machine learning to perform automatic quality control on visual data, such as images and videos. For example, image quality control tools can detect image defects such as blurriness, nudity, deepfakes, and banned content, and correct the issue or delete the image from the dataset. Image recognition : A subfield of AI and computer vision that seeks to recognize the contents of an image by describing them at a high level. For example, a trained image recognition model might be able to\\xa0distinguish between images of dogs and images of cats. Image recognition is contrasted with image segmentation, which seeks to divide an image into multiple parts (e.g. the background and different objects). Image segmentation: A subfield of computer vision that seeks to divide an image into contiguous parts by associating each pixel with a certain category, such as the background or a foreground object. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) : The use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in industrial and manufacturing contexts. IIoT devices can be used\\xa0to\\xa0inspect industrial processes, detect flaws and defects in products and manufacturing equipment, promote workplace safety by detecting the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and much more. Inference: The use of a trained machine learning model to make predictions about a previously unseen dataset. In other words, the model infers the dataset’s contents using what it has learned from the training set. Internet of Things/IoT: A vast, interconnected network of devices and sensors that communicate and exchange information via the Internet. As one of the fastest-growing tech trends (with an estimated 127 new devices being connected every second), the IoT has the potential to transform industries such as manufacturing, energy, transportation, and more. JSON response: A response to an API request that uses the popular and lightweight JSON (JavaScript Open Notation) file format . A JSON response consists of a top-level array that contains one or more key-value pairs (e.g. { “name”: “John Smith”, “age”: 30 }). Labeling: The process of\\xa0assigning a label that provides the correct context for each input in the training dataset, or the “answer” that you would like the AI model to return during training. In computer vision, there are two types of labeling: annotation and tagging. Labeling can be performed in-house or through outsourcing or crowdsourcing services. Liveness detection : A security feature for facial authentication systems to verify that a given image or video represents a live, authentic person, and not an attempt to fraudulently bypass the system (e.g. by wearing a mask of a person’s likeness, or by displaying a sleeping person’s face). Liveness detection is essential to guard against malicious actors. Machine learning : A subfield of AI and computer science that studies algorithms that can improve themselves over time by gaining more experience or viewing more data. Machine learning includes both supervised learning (in which the algorithm is given the expected results or labels) and unsupervised learning (in which the algorithm must find patterns in unlabeled data). Machine translation: The use of computers to automatically translate text from one natural (human) language to another, without assistance from a human translator. Machine vision: A subfield of AI and computer vision that combines hardware and software to enable machines to “see” at a high level as humans can. Machine vision is distinct from computer vision: a machine vision system consists of both a mechanical “body” that captures images and videos, as well as computer vision software that interprets these inputs. Metadata: Data that describes and provides information about other data. For visual data such as images and videos, metadata consists of three categories: technical (e.g. the camera type and settings), descriptive (e.g. the author, date of creation, title, contents, and keywords), and administrative (e.g. contact information and copyright). Motion tracking: A subfield of computer vision with the goal of following the motion of a person or object across multiple frames in a video. Natural language processing (NLP): A subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence with the goal of making computers understand, interpret, and generate human languages such as English. Near-edge AI : The deployment of AI systems on the “near edge,” i.e., computing infrastructure located\\xa0between the point of data collection and remote servers in the cloud. Neural network: An AI and machine learning algorithm that seeks to mimic the high-level structure of a human brain. Neural networks have many interconnected artificial “neurons” arranged in multiple layers, each one storing a signal that it can transmit to other neurons. The use of larger neural networks with many hidden layers is known as deep learning. No-code AI: The use of a no-code platform to generate AI models without the need to write lines of computer code (or be familiar with computer programming at all). Object recognition : A subfield of computer vision, artificial intelligence, and machine learning that seeks to recognize and identify the most prominent objects (i.e., people or things) in a digital image or video. Optical character recognition (OCR): A technology that recognizes handwritten or printed text and converts it into digital characters. Overfitting: A performance issue with machine learning models in which the model learns to fit the training data too closely, including excessive detail and noise. This causes the model to perform poorly on unseen test data. Because overfitting is often caused by a lack of training data, techniques such as data augmentation and synthetic data generation can help alleviate it. Pattern recognition: The use of machine learning methods to automatically identify patterns (and anomalies) in a set of input data. Pre-trained model: An AI model that has already been trained on a set of input training data. Given an input, a pre-trained model can rapidly return its prediction on that input, without needing to train the model again. Pre-trained models can also be used for transfer learning, i.e. applying knowledge to a different but similar problem (for example, from recognizing car manufacturers to truck manufacturers). Presentation attack : An attempt to thwart biometric systems by spoofing the characteristics of a different person. With facial recognition software, for example, presentati on attacks may consist of printed photographs or 3D face masks presented to the camera by the attacker. Techniques such as liveness detection are necessary to avoid presentation attacks. Recurrent neural network (RNN): A special type of neural network that uses the output of the previous step as the input to the current step. RNNs are best suited for sequential and time-based data such as text and speech. Reinforcement learning: A subfield of AI and machine learning that teaches an AI model, using trial and error, how to behave in a complex environment in order to maximize its reward. Robotic process automation (RPA): A subfield of business process automation that uses software “robots” to automate manual repetitive tasks. Robotics: An interdisciplinary field combining engineering and computer science that seeks to build intelligent machines known as “robots,” which have bodies and can take actions inthe physical world. Segmentation: A subfield of AI and computer vision that seeks to divide an image or video into multiple parts (e.g. the background and different objects). For example, an image of a crowd of people might be segmented into the outlines of each individual person, as well as the image’s background. Image segmentation is widely used for applications such as healthcare (e.g. identifying cancerous cells in a medical image). Sentiment detection: A subfield of AI and computer vision that seeks to understand the tone of a given\\xa0text. This may include determining whether a text has a positive, negative, or neutral opinion, or whether it contains a certain emotional state (e.g. “sad,” “angry,” or “happy”). Strong AI: A synonym for artificial general intelligence (AGI). “Strong AI” refers to a theoretical AI model that could duplicate or even surpass human capability across a wide spectrum of activities, serving as a machine “brain.” Structured data : Data that adheres to a known, predefined schema, making it easier to query and analyze. Examples of structured data include student records (with fields such as name, class year, GPA,\\xa0etc.), and daily stock prices. Supervised learning: A subfield of machine learning that uses both input data and the expected output labels during the training process. In this way, the computer can easily identify and correct its mistakes. Synthetic data : Realistic but computer-generated image data that can be used\\xa0to\\xa0increase the size of your datasets during AI training. Using a 3D model and its associated texture, synthetic data (and the corresponding annotations or bounding boxes) can be generated with a wide variety of poses, viewpoints, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. Tagging: The process of\\xa0labeling the input data with a single tag in preparation for AI training. Tagging is similar to annotation, but uses only a single label for each piece of input data. For example, if you want to perform image recognition for different dog breeds, your tags may be “golden retriever,” “bulldog,” etc. Transfer learning: A machine learning technique that reuses a model trained for one problem on a different but related problem, shortening the training process. For example, transfer learning could apply a model trained to recognize car makes and models to identify trucks instead. Turing test: A metric proposed by Alan Turing for assessing a machine’s “intelligence” by testing whether it can convince a human questioner that it is a person and not a computer. Unstructured data : Data that does not adhere to a predefined schema, making it more flexible but harder to analyze. Examples of unstructured data include text, images, and videos. Unsupervised learning: A subfield of machine learning that provides only input data, but not the expected output, during the training process. This requires the computer to identify hidden patterns and construct its own model of the data. Video analytics : The use of AI and computer vision to automatically analyze the contents of a video. This may include facial recognition, motion detection, and/or object detection. Video analytics is widely used in industries such as security, construction, retail, and healthcare, for applications from loss prevention to health and safety. Visual AI : The use of artificial intelligence to interpret visual data (i.e. images and videos), roughly synonymous with computer vision. Weak AI: A synonym for artificial narrow intelligence (ANI). “Weak AI” refers to an AI model that focuses on equaling or surpassing human performance on a particular task or set of tasks, with an intentionally limited scope.

       "  'text': '4 Keys to Edge AI and Internet of Things Deployments | Chooch Deploying IoT involves the installation of infrastructure, specific sensors, computers and cameras. However, to successfully deploy IoT this must also include real-time analytics, and introducing AI technologies into the mix creates AIoT. AI on the network edge detects and reports on events detected by sensors and results in four distinct benefits. Real Time Analytics Fully Deployed Intelligence Combining AI Technologies Completing the Lifecycle Real-Time Analytics Event stream processing analyzes different types of data and is able to successfully identify which data is relevant. To handle such data, event stream processing can: Identify important events and prompt the necessary action: Detection of all relevant events or events that are of some interest is possible through event stream processing. These include unusual activities during bank transactions or actions on mobile. Constantly monitor the information that is being gathered: Event stream processing can quickly detect any irregularities that can become potential problems. If such situations arise, smart devices can immediately alert the concerned operator and use corrective measures. Make sure that the sensor data is clean and authentic: You might find certain inconsistencies in the sensor data. This can be due to network errors or even dirty data. Data streams have techniques to check for discrepancies and troubleshoot if required. Improve operations in real-time: Optimization of operations in real-time is possible with advanced algorithms. For example, the arrival time of a train can be constantly updated, especially if there is a delay in any particular station. Using Intelligence Where the Application Requires It Data is constantly being generated by AIoT devices. Therefore analytics should be applied in different ways to get the best possible outcome. These different methods of deploying intelligence include: High-performance analytics: Heavy performance analytics can be deployed on data that is not moving or is in the storage. It can be also used when the data is in the cloud. Streaming analytics: When large amounts of moving data need to be analyzed for a few items of interest, streaming analytics should be used. Streaming analytics can also be used if the speed is critical and alerts for an imminent crash or component failure that needs to be sent. Edge computing: Edge computing immediately triggers necessary action on any data. It does not wait to ingest, store or move data anywhere without acting on it first. Combining AI Technologies A combination of AI technologies can provide many opportunities and the best outcome. For example, machine learning, language processing, and computer vision can happen simultaneously. Here’s an example/ Deep learning and computer vision can be used by clinics or hospitals for accurate radiographs, CT scans, and MRIs. To build patient profiles, detailing the family history of medical issues, natural language processing can be easily used along with computer vision to make the data far more accessible and accurate. Unifying the Complete Analytics Life Cycle To predict what will happen and to analyze what is happening in real-time, AI systems should have access to various kinds of data. If IoT is successfully implemented, the AI systems will be able to link all the following capabilities: Data analysis on the fly: This is event stream processing where large amounts of data are analyzed to find any relevant information. Real-time decision making: In case of data in motion or streaming data, if an event of interest occurs then immediately the necessary action should be triggered. Big data analytics: Large amounts of data can be ingested and processed when intelligence is obtained from IoT. This usually happens in a computing environment and running more iterations and using all of the data can also improve the precision of the model. Data management: Proper data management can clean and validate all kinds of data even when it is available in different formats. Analytical model management: Analytical model management is consistent and covers everything, from registration to retirement. The evolution of models can also be tracked and the performances are constantly improved. Ready to deploy AIoT? Chooch exports inference engines and installs computer vision on devices for Edge AI .

       "  'text': 'Visual AI For Detecting Defects & Obstacles On Railways | Chooch Railway operators must conduct routine inspections and maintenance of tracks, trains, and other equipment to ensure the safe operation of railways. Through these inspection and maintenance activities, railway operators prevent service interruptions and, most importantly, reduce the chances of catastrophic railway accidents by resolving some of the most common causes of accidents, such as train and equipment failures, track defects, and other issues. While trains require more maintenance than any other piece of railroad infrastructure, tracks are also highly prone to causing breakdowns and delays when neglected. Ultimately, the successful completion of detailed visual inspections of trains, tracks, and other equipment is the first line of defense against neglected maintenance issues leading to accidents. Beyond routine maintenance inspections and repairs, train conductors and engineers help prevent accidents by constantly watching for obstacles – such as vehicles, rocks, trees, livestock, and people – on the tracks ahead. If train drivers detect these obstacles early enough, there’s a better chance of avoiding a disastrous accident. The latest computer vision technology offers railway operators tremendous ROI benefits in terms of earlier and more affordable detection of defects and obstacles . In fact, computer vision offers dramatic efficiency improvements over traditional methods of defect and obstacle detection. Traditional Methods of Railway Defect and Obstacle Detection Traditional methods for detecting rail- and train-related flaws and maintenance issues include visual inspection, ultrasound, liquid penetration inspection (LPI), radiography, and more. Visual inspections are particularly costly and inconvenient to perform, as they require teams of highly trained technicians to walk along tracks and trains to look for problems in need of repair. Railways also use cameras to assist with the inspection process. During rail and train inspections, human technicians must visually evaluate the condition of rails, ties, track ballast, mounting systems, train wheels, train undercarriages, and other details. Human errors and oversights abound in this process, and it’s not uncommon for inspectors to accidentally overlook a glaring maintenance concern that needs immediate repair to prevent train derailment or service shutdowns. As discussed in further detail below, railway operators incur massive costs when these defects go unnoticed. As for obstacle detection, conductors and engineers must rely on their keen eyesight and focus. Unfortunately, it usually doesn’t matter how early conductors can visually identify an obstacle. Trains typically cannot stop quickly enough to avoid a collision. The Challenges of Visual Defect and Obstacle Detection Despite spending millions of dollars each year to inspect North American railroads, railway inspection processes are fraught with problems and errors. This is mostly the result of: Staff shortages: Cost cuts and a lack of skilled inspectors mean that some railway operators may not have enough inspectors on hand to monitor all track assets with sufficient regularity and attention to detail. Poor management decisions surrounding inspections: Railway industry managers are prone to making mistakes when it comes to balancing the limited resources they can direct toward track inspection and maintenance. This can result in the neglect of track and train assets that need more attention and care. Inadequately performed inspections: Human railway inspectors are prone to missing details and making mistakes as a result of strict time constraints, distraction, fatigue, and the limitations of human capacity. A lack of regular inspections: Some railway operators must divert their limited inspection resources to key pieces of infrastructure. This can lead to infrequent or inadequate inspections of less essential sections of track. Human limitation: Train engineers are limited by how far ahead they can see. Plus, a curving track, trees, and buildings could obscure upcoming obstacles. This makes it difficult to detect livestock, people, and other obstacles early enough to stop the train to avert a collision. Train track suicides are also common. Tragically, many engineers remember the times they weren’t able to stop the train in time to prevent someone from dying. The Cost of Railway Inspection Errors and Train Accidents Failure to detect maintenance issues results in railroad operators finding out about problems too late – and the costs can be catastrophic. In these cases, an easily fixable defect can turn into a problem that’s expensive to repair or results in a serious accident. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration, human error, track failures, miscellaneous factors (such as collisions with obstacles, animals, and people), and equipment failures cause the majority of train accidents. Some of the costs associated with failing to detect railroad defects and obstacles include: Replacing and repairing train equipment and railroad tracks. Higher repair and maintenance costs. Personal injuries and wrongful death liabilities. Damage to goods and supplies the train was transporting. Lost customers and fewer sales from reputation damage and service delays. Environmental impact and cleanup of hazardous material spills. Psychological and emotional turmoil experienced by train drivers after witnessing a human death. Leveraging Visual AI for Better Railway Defect and Obstacle Detection Visual AI technology can offer a cost-effective and highly efficient solution for detecting defects and obstacles earlier, more accurately, and dramatically more affordably than railway operators can achieve with human inspectors and train engineers alone. Computer vision strategies for railroad defect and obstacle detection leverage the following features: High-definition cameras mounted on the undercarriages, fronts, and sides of railway cars and along railway tracks. Servers running sophisticated AI models that interpret visual data. Infrared and high-definition cameras that scan railway tracks for obstacles like animals, rocks, trees, people, vehicles, and debris. Instant reports and alerts sent to decision-makers who can immediately trigger a repair request for further investigation. Instant reports and alerts sent to train conductors and engineers who can slow down or stop trains as early as possible to prevent collisions. With Chooch AI computer vision technology, railway operators can rapidly train visual AI models to detect all types of visually perceivable defects and objects. In fact, Chooch AI can develop, train, and implement a custom visual AI strategy in only six to nine days. In this short amount of time, railway operators can start to realize the tremendous ROI benefits that come from faster, more accurate, and more affordable railway defect and obstacle detection. In summary, Chooch AI computer vision models for the railroad industry can help railway operators: Detect obstacles in the path of trains earlier than human engineers to provide additional time to prevent collisions and suicides. Visually detect maintenance issues on trains, wheels, and undercarriages. Visually identify track defects related to welds, cracks, and other maintenance issues. Evaluate the conditions of railway ties, track ballast, and mounting systems. Reduce train accidents and associated costs and damages. Reduce the cost of track, train, and equipment inspections. Reduce the cost of track, train, and equipment maintenance through earlier detection of defects and problems . Share Featured Articles Edge AI When is the Right Time to Deploy Edge Computing?

       "  'text': 'Training Computer Vision AI Models With Synthetic Data | Chooch Powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning , computer vision can help digitally transform your business. Today, sophisticated computer vision AI models can learn to recognize a wide variety of faces, objects, concepts, and actions, just as well as—if not even better than—humans can. But… There’s just one problem: where are you going to get the data? For best results during AI training, you need to collect potentially hundreds or thousands of images or videos. The more training data you can obtain, the better your computer vision models can learn how to classify different visual phenomena. For example, suppose that you want to build a computer vision model that can differentiate between images of dogs and cats. If you only use high-quality photographs as your training data, with each animal close up and facing the camera, then your model might struggle to generalize to real-world situations, with\\xa0types of data that it hasn’t seen before. Some difficulties with image recognition are: Different viewpoints: The subject may be photographed from many viewpoints, e.g. from behind, from below, from far away, etc. Different lighting conditions: The color and appearance of an object (e.g. an animal’s fur) may vary significantly, depending on the amount of light in the photograph. Variations within classes: Objects that are classified in the same category may still appear dissimilar—e.g. animals with wildly different colors, breeds, and appearances that are all classified as “dog” or “cat.” Occlusion: Computer vision models need to recognize objects that are partially hidden within the image. For example, the model can’t simply learn that all dogs appear to have four legs—or else it won’t recognize dogs inside blankets and dogs looking out a car window. In order to be responsive to these issues, your computer vision model needs to be trained on large amounts of labeled, high-quality, and highly diverse data. Unfortunately, generating this type of data manually can be difficult and time-consuming. Solving the Problem of Limited Data for Computer Vision One solution is to perform data augmentation: increasing the amount of training data by making slight modifications to each image. For example, an image of a dog may be slightly rotated, flipped, shifted, or cropped (or all of the above). This will help the model learn the underlying truth about what a dog looks like, rather than over-fitting by learning to recognize the image itself and knowing that “dog” is the right answer. A single image can produce a dozen or more augmented images that can help your computer vision model extrapolate better in real-world scenarios. Generating Synthetic Data for Computer Vision In addition to simple data augmentations, there’s another solution to the problem of data sparsity: you can generate synthetic data. If you have a realistic 3D model of the object you want to recognize, you can instantly generate hundreds or thousands of images of that 3D object with synthetic data generation . You can vary nearly everything about the object and image—viewpoints, pose, backgrounds, lighting conditions, etc.—so that your computer vision model gets a vastly greater range of realistic training data. You can automatically create bounding box annotations around the object’s position, rather than having to label each image yourself in a slow, manual process. If your 3D model is made up of many smaller parts (e.g. a lawnmower or other machinery), you can even generate data for object segmentation, so that the computer vision model learns to recognize each individual object part. By using synthetic data generation, computer vision users can rapidly build and iterate AI models and deploy them to the edge. Chooch is a computer vision vendor that helps businesses of all sizes and industries—from healthcare and construction to retail and geospatial —build cutting- edge computer vision models. Our synthetic data generation feature makes it easy for users to increase the diversity and versatility of their training data. All you need are two files: an\\xa0.OBJ file that describes the object’s 3D geometry, and an\\xa0.MTL file that describes the object’s appearance and textures.

       "  'text': 'Computer Vision For Cell Identification And Counting | Chooch Counting and identifying cells is a tedious and time-consuming process. In many cases, highly paid Ph.D. scientists perform these tasks in the fields of histology, immunology, oncology, and pharmaceutical research. Unfortunately, the painstaking process involves long hours of looking at samples under a microscope and manually counting each cell – even worse, traditional cell counting methods leave a lot to be desired in terms of accuracy. Even the highest-trained scientists working under the best laboratory conditions rarely achieve better than 80% accuracy. Meanwhile, the time and labor costs required to complete these tasks represent a massive expenditure for laboratories. Interestingly, computer vision technology for cell counting offers a compelling solution to these inefficiencies. By leveraging an advanced visual AI platform like Chooch AI , labs can dramatically improve the speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency of cell counting activities. Many labs have boosted cell counting accuracy up to 98% – while reducing their skilled labor requirements. In this respect, computer vision for cell counting offers a clear ROI benefit compared to traditional methods. Traditional Methods of Cell Counting and Identification The hemocytometer still prevails as the most practical solution for the vast majority of cell counting use cases. This 19th-century tool consists of a slide with two gridded counting chambers. Scientists manually count the number of cells in the counting chambers to achieve a “workable” estimate of the concentration of cells. Samples generally require dilution, which can render less accurate results. The hemocytometer process is 80% accurate at best. This method is labor-intensive, and renders less than perfect results, but it’s adequate for many use cases. Another cell counting method involves the use of plating and Colony Forming Unit (CFU) counting. Scientists dilute a cell sample and plate the sample on a petri dish with a growth medium. From there, each cell grows into a colony of cells or CFU after at least 12 hours of growth. Next, scientists manually count each colony to determine the concentration of cells. This method is particularly useful when testing cell resistance to drugs. However, like the hemocytometer, this method is labor-intensive and monotonous, so fatigue and human counting errors are common. There are two more approaches to cell counting that render faster, more accurate results for many use cases. One involves the use of automated cell counters for cell and bacteria enumeration. The other involves the use of flow cytometer equipment. Unfortunately, these last two methods are so expensive that they’re only available to the most distinguished and well-funded research laboratories. Even for the facilities that can afford them, cell counters and flow cytometer equipment bring considerable operational costs and maintenance burdens. For these reasons, a recent study concluded: “In the low-resource-setting laboratories, standard hemocytometers are the only choice for quantification of cells and bacteria.” In this respect, there is a need for an affordable, automated, and accurate method for counting cells and bacteria that is more efficient than hemocytometers. Disadvantages of Manually Counting Cells The process of manually counting cells under a microscope comes with a number of disadvantages that, in most cases, laboratories have accepted as an inherent part of the process. These disadvantages include: Accuracy problems: Scientists can only achieve an 80% accuracy level under the best of circumstances when using a hemocytometer. Expensive labor: The average annual salary for a cell culture scientist in the United States is $85,042. Employing a team of scientists devoted to cell counting represents a significant cost for any research facility. Slow process: Scientists can take 30 minutes or longer to count the cells in a single hemocytometer slide. This brings a significant delay to any research or diagnostic activities that require cell counting, which slows down the completion of research, patient diagnoses, and the release of new medicines. Scientists prone to fatigue and distraction: The monotonous nature of manually counting cells fatigues scientists and hinders counting accuracy. Limitations of human perception: Human perception is limited in terms of the ability to perceive the difference between cells, cell debris, and other particles. In fact, it’s not uncommon for two scientists to give a significantly different result when counting the same sample. Highly diluted samples obscure results: Scientists need to dilute samples, which reduces the concentration of cells to make cell counting easier. However, this dilution process can interfere with the ability to produce statistically significant calculations. In other words, the sample could be diluted so much that counting produces inaccurate results. Leveraging Visual AI for Better Cell Counting Results Computer vision technology is perfectly suited to automate the task of manually identifying and counting cells. For example, the Chooch AI platform is capable of identifying and counting cells with dramatically more accurate results than its human counterparts – even compared to the results of Ph.D. scientists and experienced research physicians. The tremendous ROI benefits of computer vision technology for cell counting include: Faster cell counting results: Chooch AI completes 30-minute cell counting tasks in milliseconds, allowing the platform to achieve millions of human counting hours in just a few minutes. Improved accuracy: Chooch AI achieves 98% accuracy for most cell counting procedures. This is a striking improvement over the 80% standard for cell counting via traditional methods. Faster, better workflows: The speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency benefits of computer vision for cell counting allow laboratories to analyze higher volumes of samples faster and more affordably. Labor cost savings: Chooch AI brings tremendous labor cost savings while freeing skilled scientists and doctors to devote their time to more important tasks. More competitive drug research: With pharmaceutical companies racing to test and release new drugs as quickly as possible, the efficiency of visual AI helps drug companies bring new medicines to market in record time. Better patient outcomes: Computer vision speeds the process of conducting a complete blood count analysis, and accurately counting blood, plasma, and lymph cells. This empowers healthcare practitioners to achieve better patient outcomes by reducing instances of delayed diagnoses and misdiagnoses. Lower sample dilution requirement: Computer vision solutions for cell counting are capable of accurately counting the cells in less diluted samples. By reducing the level of dilution, scientists can achieve more accurate counting results. One of the primary advantages of Chooch AI is speed of implementation. With Chooch, laboratories can develop and deploy sophisticated computer vision models for cell counting in a matter of days. This is markedly faster than the six to nine months it generally takes to design and implement a visual AI model. Chooch AI offers research laboratories immediate access to a wide library of pre-built computer vision models for the most common cell counting use cases. For more unique scenarios, laboratories can add layers of training to existing models – or train entirely new models from scratch – depending on the needs of the use case. The ROI benefits of computer vision for cell counting are clear. With these new tools, medical labs diagnose patients faster and more accurately; drug companies develop new life-saving medications with greater efficiency; and, skilled scientists and doctors have extra time to devote to more pressing tasks.

       "  'text': 'Leveraging AI for Better Patient Monitoring | Chooch Healthcare facilities throughout the world are suffering from critical staff shortages, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only made the situation worse. According to November 2020 statistics from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 18% of U.S. hospitals said that they were critically short on medical staff. Patient monitoring AI can dramatically improve the ability of hospitals and medical facilities to monitor situations. Staffing shortages have made it difficult for hospitals to provide sufficient monitoring of patients who require immediate attention. Tragically, a wide range of patient behaviors – like sitting up, getting out of bed, coughing, falling, or gesturing for help – go unnoticed until it’s too late to help the patient in need. Patient monitoring AI can be life saving in these situations. The Tragic Cost of Patient Monitoring Failures Diligent visual monitoring of patients is key to ensuring the best medical outcomes, but even a fully staffed hospital or medical facility can’t keep an eye on everything. Here are some examples of the tragic cost of patient monitoring failures: Falls Medical patients in hospitals, nursing homes, and other health facilities are more prone to fall injuries. For example, PSNet reports that medical patients fall approximately 3 to 5 times per 1,000 bed-days . The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports that an estimated 700,000 to 1 million hospital patients fall every year. Moreover, approximately 50% of the 1.6 million U.S. nursing home residents fall every year. Sadly, over 33% of hospital patient falls result in an injury – and many of these injuries are serious, involving fractures and head trauma. Beyond the injuries, hospital patient falls may be classified as “ never events, ” which means that the Centers for Medical and Medicaid Services will not reimburse hospitals for the additional medical costs related to the falls, representing a significant financial burden on the hospital. Considering the risk of fall injuries at medical facilities, medical staff need to know whenever an at-risk patient gets out of bed or suffers a fall. However, it’s impossible to constantly monitor all patients at all times. Considering that medical facilities are usually short on staff, it’s not uncommon for a fallen patient to be left unattended, which can lead to devastating health consequences. Coughing, Hand Gestures, and Spasms Patients suffering from coughing fits – or various types of hand gestures and bodily spasms – could be in dire need of assistance to ensure that they are breathing properly and not experiencing a health emergency. Any delay in detecting a patient in this kind of situation could result in a worsened health condition or death. In many cases, health facilities can be held liable for their patient monitoring failures – especially if those failures are the result of negligence and result in serious injuries or death. Aside from the tragic health consequences and negative impact on patient families, monitoring failures damage the reputations of medical facilities, increase liabilities, and elevate insurance costs. Leveraging Visual AI for Better Patient Monitoring Patient monitoring AI technologies can dramatically improve the ability of hospitals and medical facilities to detect instances of patients falling, in addition to monitoring patient behaviors and gestures. A trained computer vision system for patient monitoring can easily detect the following patient gestures, movements, and behaviors: A hospital patient, ICU patient, post-op patient, or visitor who falls down. A patient who swings his or her legs over the side of a bed in preparation to get up. A patient who suddenly sits up in bed. A patient who is suffering from a coughing fit, sneezing fit, or body spasms. A patient who is gesturing his or her arms for help. A patient with a bloody nose after reacting badly to a drug protocol. At Chooch AI, we can train sophisticated computer vision models to detect all of the above and more. Deployable through the cloud – or on edge devices for maximum security and privacy – these devices can use an existing IoT camera network to gather and interpret visual data on patient and hospital visitor activities. Chooch can also install a visual AI system for patient monitoring on a rollable cart that includes (1) a monitoring camera on the top and (2) a visual AI edge server on the bottom. Medical staff can position these carts in rooms to monitor patient behavior and provide immediate updates and alerts as required. Any hospital or medical facility can develop and deploy visual AI strategies like these, and start achieving better patient outcomes in a matter of days. In summary, Chooch AI computer vision models for patient monitoring AI can help hospitals and medical facilities: Monitor patient conditions with greater accuracy and attention to detail. Instantly respond to patient emergencies as soon as a problem arises. More immediately help patients who are experiencing adverse reactions to drugs. Receive instant alerts when a patient or anyone in the hospital falls. Detect unusual patient behaviors such as a patient getting ready to exit his or her bed, coughing, sneezing, or gesturing for help.

       "  'text': 'AI Model Deployments for Edge AI with Chooch AI Platform | Chooch In this 15 minute presentation, Emrah Gultekin, CEO of Chooch AI, presents how the Chooch AI platform ingests visual data, trains the AI, and exports AI models to the edge. This allows scalable inferencing on the edge on any number of devices from any number of cameras. A transcript of the presentation is provided below the video. Hi, everybody. So today we’re going to be talking a little bit about Edge AI and how that is performed, so let me go ahead and share my screen. So mass deployment of AI models on the Edge, that’s what this is about today. Basically, what we do here at Chooch is there are three components that make up the entire system, and one is the dashboard, and that’s the cloud account that you have. And that’s really crucial because that’s where you create the account, that’s where you select your pre-trained models, you can actually train new models on the account, you can add devices, and so forth. So that’s one part of it. The next part is the device itself on the Edge , which is usually an NVIDIA device. And then the third component is the camera, so any type of imaging that’s coming in. So the camera’s associated with the device and that’s where the inferences are done, and you’re able to manage all that on premise and on the Cloud. So here’s an example of what the output looks like on any of these devices and cameras that you have, so safety vests, hard hats, and whatever you basically train it for. And so these are outputs that are saved on the device, and you can create alerts, or you can create SMS messages or email messages, depending on your use case. And you could aggregate all this information and generate the reports as well. So if we look at AI as a whole, in terms of the different areas and the different types of things that you need to do to make it work properly, we’re looking at three main areas, and that’s dataset generation, which is the first bit of it, that’s the most crucial part of it in terms of starting out. And then the second part is training, over here. So that’s where you create the models. And then inferencing, and that’s when you have new predictions coming in, so you have new data coming in and it generates inferences which are predictions of what it sees. So this is like the cycle of it, and then the inferencing goes back into dataset generation as well. So if you have new types of information coming in, new types of data or video streams, it’s important to feed it back into dataset generation to refine the model and also update it, or basically, maybe train new classes or new models as well. So the device is really crucial here because that’s where it is on the Edge , and you have a device and a camera that looks at the area, and then it does inferencing. So what’s important here is to be able to put all these streams onto the devices. And the reason is the network load is very low, there is no network load on the device, obviously, so you don’t have to send anything to the Cloud. The second issue is privacy, everything stays on the device. And a third is speed, it’s two milliseconds per inference. So it’s far faster than anything that you’re going to do on the Cloud. We have many, many devices and many models, and you can manage these devices and the models from your dashboard. And then the camera is associated with the device. So you create a device, and then you add cameras to it, and you can add multiple streams to any of these NVIDIA devices. So let’s start with dataset generation AI training. That’s really, really crucial over here, just how we do it. So on the dashboard, what you do is you first, it depends what you’re doing, so it’s facial image or object. Object is the most complex, so we start with that. Here, you create a dataset. Let’s do that. So it’ll ask you to upload images or videos, so you can upload images or videos to create your dataset, and it asks you if you want to do bounding box or polygon annotation. Annotation is a way to label what’s inside of that image or inside of that video. So we’ll go into some examples for that as well. Here’s let’s say a raw image of what you want to train. And what you start doing is basically doing bounding boxes. And if it’s polygon, then you would do segmentation. Here you would do it, and name what you’re looking at, so it could be “hardhat”, it could’ve been “red hardhat” and then security Avast and so forth. So you basically do this manually. If it’s an unknown object in the dataset, it’ll start giving you these. So you upload these, you annotate them manually. If it’s something new, you have to do it manually. If it’s a known object that the system already knows, it provides you with suggestions, so it creates a dataset. And here you are, 141 images of a hard hat and 74 security Avast. So this would be the raw images, so you would have raw annotations here. And then what happens in the back is this would be augmented by about x18 images in order to enrich the dataset. So it changes it, augments it in the backend. Here you then create a perception. So you go back and you say, “Hey, We have the dataset, now let’s create the perception,” which is the model. And you name your perception, then you select the dataset, you can reuse these datasets obviously, for different types of models that you’re building. And then it starts training it. And then you can see the log of what’s going on. And then it’s actually trained. And here, you can do a test via upload and test your new perception, your new model, and then basically provide feedback to the model. And it’ll generate also an F1 score with it. Here, you can see the JSON response, so this is the raw JSON with the class title and the coordinates of what you’re looking at, what it predicts. And here’s the F1 score. This is an accuracy score. So the model generates automatically the accuracy of those particular classes. But that’s not enough, because what you need to do is go back and check it as a human. And this is done manually, pre deployment usually, or after deployment sometimes it’s done as well. And what you want to do is you want to be able to have an F1 score which is above 90%. And that’s what this is about. You’re able to download this and actually test many images of it. So device deployment and camera management, this is also crucial. So let’s say you’re using a pre-trained model or pre-trained perception, or you’ve kind of trained your own thing. You want to deploy these onto the Edge so that the inferencing is done on the edge. And here you have the device that you want to generate, so you go onto other devices, you create the device, this is office device, device for whatever office here, and it’ll create the device, right? It’ll have a device ID on it. And then what you want to do is you want to add cameras to it, right? So you have your Jetson line or your T4, and then you want to add a camera to it, or cameras, multiple cameras. You add the camera, name it, the RTSP feed as well, and then you select your perceptions that you want to put onto this device. So let’s say it’s the hard hat one, or whatever, fall detection . You add these to the device, and you could see that here, it’s added to the device, and boom, it starts working. So what we’re really doing here is training on the Cloud and then deploying the model onto the Edge, pre-trained as well, or you want to deploy something that you’ve trained, it doesn’t really matter. But you’re able to push it out onto the device. And the device actually syncs up with your Cloud account anytime it has connectivity. You can use it without connectivity, obviously, but you can use it with connectivity as well, and it’ll sync automatically if you want it to sync automatically with the Cloud account, if you’ve trained, retrained, a model, or you’ve done something new, or just basic system updates that you might have. So this is an example of masks and no masks. This is an example of social distancing. So you could put all these onto the Edge so that they work exclusively. So basically, what happens with the Edge is you don’t stream anything to the Cloud and in doing so it works 24/7 without any type of burden to the network. And it’s also very, very expensive to do that on the Cloud. This is people counting. This is fall detection . These are examples of anything that you want to train, or you want to use anything that’s pre-trained, you’re able to do that. Fire detection. And you’re able to select the pre-trained and deploy them immediately, if you want to use any of the pre-trained stuff. But you might have a use case where you want something specific and you would work with us so that that becomes trained. And we do the training very, very quickly, depending on the data that our clients provide. So here you have many, many devices, and you can manage all these devices and all the models on them remotely, and it does the inferencing on those devices. So, thank you. If you have any questions about Edge AI , please out to us, [email\\xa0protected] , and we look forward to keep working with with the ecosystem. Thank you. So what’s crucial here is to be able to deploy these models and perceptions on the Edge, on multiple devices and through multiple cameras. And that’s what this is really about. And to be able to manage those at scale. So to be able to do that, we built the system which is the dashboard where you have your models, and where you have your devices, and where you manage those devices and cameras. And then physically, you need to have these cameras hooked up to the devices, whether any of the Jetsons or on-prem, such as the T4s, and to be able to manage these and to be able to update these at one time. So to be able to train something new, deploy it on multiple devices, scale it, and also to be able to retrain it and to have them synced. So AI is not about static models. It’s about dynamic models, and also dynamic situations where you have these different devices out there with different types of camera angles, different types of cameras, and so forth. So be able to do this at scale and to be able to manage all of it, and that’s what we’ve done as a company is to provide you with the Chooch AI platform in order to deploy these very, very quickly, you’re able to do the Docker, download the Docker, set up in two and a half, three minutes, and then basically scale it out depending on what your use case might be. So it’s really important that we recognize what this is all about. This is all about efficiency, and to be able to do these at scale, and to be able to do it very quickly. And that’s what we’ve done as a company. Thank you for listening to this. This is all about the Edge, being able to do the inferencing on the Edge, being able to deploy these models, deploy these devices on the Edge, and to be able to provide that type of inferencing and that type of data. And we look forward to continue working with the ecosystem here. Share Featured Articles Edge AI When is the Right Time to Deploy Edge Computing? AI Definitions What is Computer Vision?

       "  'text': 'Visual AI for Digital Asset Management (DAM) | Chooch The use of Digital Asset Management (DAM) software is vital for any organization managing large terabytes of visual media. Despite the usefulness of this highly sophisticated software, teams of human workers are still required to annotate, index, timestamp, and control the quality of assets like photographs and video. Not only is the process costly and time-consuming, but it’s also fraught with errors and inadequacies. Now, media companies and retailers are achieving dramatic ROI benefits by adopting computer vision strategies to fully automate these time-consuming annotation and indexing tasks. Why Is DAM Important? Many enterprises — especially media companies — are managing millions of images and billions of seconds of video. The more these companies understand media in their archives, the faster they can find “XYZ,” as soon as the need arises. Also, by implementing quality control standards, retailers can better align images and video with their marketing and branding standards. Unfortunately, most companies don’t fully know what’s available in their DAM archives and they can’t control the quality of their visual data. This is not because they don’t see the value of better DAM. It’s because of the enormous cost, time — and in many cases impossibility — of employing human workers to accurately annotate and control the quality of their vast reserves of data Leveraging Visual AI for More Efficient Digital Media Management An advanced computer vision solution can fully automate the process of analyzing and annotating both photographs and video through “smart annotation.” Even if the annotation process requires highly skilled and experienced professionals — such as an expert on celebrities or clothing styles — a Chooch AI strategy can achieve the job with greater accuracy, speed, and affordability. Case Study Example 1: A Television Station Needs to Annotate a Vast Media Archive At Chooch AI, we develop agile, powerful, and highly affordable computer vision strategies for the widest range of use cases. Recently, one of our partners connected us with a television station managing a video reel archive consisting of millions of seconds of recorded content. Periodically, the station needs to locate a small clip of a celebrity for an advertising spot. For example, they might need to find some video of Emeril Lagasse inside their vast library of recorded video data to include in a 30-second preview of an upcoming show. Unfortunately, most of their video is completely un-indexed, so employees could spend a month scanning through content just to find the clip they need. Multiply this task by 100 for a large media company, and you can start to understand how time-consuming and expensive the process can be. With a DAM computer vision strategy from Chooch AI , the television station implemented a ready-made visual AI model that recognizes over 400 celebrity faces. Using this system, the station was able to instantly index and timestamp all of their video archives according to where different celebrities were found — a process that would have taken a team of human workers years to complete. Case Study Example 2: An Online Used Car Retailer Needs to Implement Photograph Quality Control Standards In another case, an online auto reseller contacted Chooch AI to develop a strategy that would enforce quality control standards on dealer-submitted images. The retailer found that dealer-submitted listings were more successful when they featured clear, well-framed photos with all three tires visible. They also found that distracting objects in the shots — like trash or half-empty water bottles — were damaging to sales. Despite clear guidelines for photo submission, the auto reseller dealers were submitting poor-quality photos, and they did not have enough human photo inspectors to implement strict quality control standards. With a computer vision system from Chooch AI , the auto reseller was able to implement pre-trained visual AI models for quality control purposes. These models recognize problems related to trash, bottles, framing, blurriness, and brightness — automating the process of disqualifying images based on these criteria. This has dramatically boosted sales on the platform by improving the quality and effectiveness of images. Final Thoughts on Computer Vision for DAM Among the efficiency and accuracy benefits of Chooch AI , one of the most impressive characteristics of the platform is speed of implementation. Digital media managers can quickly train AI models to analyze and annotate visual media data based on nearly any criteria. In fact, Chooch AI users can design, develop, and deploy an entirely unique computer vision strategy in just 6 to 9 days. In this short amount of time, you can start to reap tremendous ROI benefits by eliminating the endless hours of monotonous and expensive human labor required to index and find the clips and photographs you need.

       "  'text': '6 Computer Vision AI Enterprise Applications | Chooch As computer vision is becoming increasingly sophisticated, it brings business benefits to a wide variety of industries. From defect detection to loss prevention, computer vision is a powerful tool with the potential to improve processes and results in many contexts. But before we dive into the use cases of computer vision, let’s define what it is. What is computer vision? Computer vision is often confused with Artificial Intelligence (AI) , but it is not quite the same thing. Computer vision is the ability of computers to “see”, analyze and understand images or videos. AI, on the other hand, is when computers perform tasks that usually would require human intelligence. Simply put, computer vision is the “human eyes” of the computer, while AI is the “human brain.” One could also say that computer vision is AI applied to the visual world. Visual data that computer vision can process include images and videos captured by cameras, 3D scanners, and medical scanners. Today, computer vision is sophisticated enough to outperform the human eye. In this article, we’ll look at the business applications of computer vision solutions and how they can improve safety and efficiency – while lowering costs – in 6 different industries. 1. Retail Computer vision optimizes processes and improves the customer experience, both in brick and mortar stores and online. Improved operations and reduced costs: Computer vision allows retailers to speed up processes such as inventory management, payments, and compliance. Automated\\xa0planogram analysis\\xa0can save time, reduce space wastage and suggest the most optimal shelf placement for each product. Increased security and reduced shrinkage: Shoplifting and employee theft are costing retailers a staggering $100 billion globally every year. Computer vision can spot suspicious activities and provide heat maps of shoppers moving around the store – real-time data that helps ensure health and safety. Improved customer experience: Computer vision can improve in-store marketing in several ways. Facial recognition enables retailers to identify regular customers and provide personalized service. Coupons and offers can be personalized, and products can be suggested based on previous purchases. Learn more about Chooch’s Retail AI\\xa0solutions . 2. Healthcare Computer vision helps medical professionals save time and optimize workflows. A growing number of doctors are using it to diagnose their patients and prescribe the right treatments. Increased patient safety: Computer vision improves diagnostic accuracy, reducing the number of unnecessary procedures and expensive therapies. It can detect illnesses that can otherwise be difficult to identify, such as neurological illnesses . Increased accuracy and quicker diagnosis mean lower costs, both for the patient and the care provider.\\xa0Facial authentication\\xa0prevents misidentification of patients and increases the security of medical facilities. Increased operational efficiency: Doctors traditionally spend a lot of their time analyzing images and reports. Computer vision frees up their time so that they can spend it with patients instead. This means quicker care at a lower cost . Computer vision can also be used to monitor operating room procedures and provide automatic surgical logs. When activities such as anesthetization, chest closure, and instrument usage are logged, it reduces errors and increases efficiency. Medical imaging and measuring blood loss: Computer vision is used in medical imaging, where a recent example is the detection of COVID-19 in lung X-ray images with 98% accuracy . The Orlando Health Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies uses computer vision to measure blood loss during childbirth. Before, it was impossible to know how much blood a mother was loosing. But with computer vision, images of surgical sponges and suction canisters can be used to measure blood loss. Contact us about healthcare AI 3. Manufacturing In the industrial sector, human error can cause dangerous situations and expensive mistakes. Computer vision efficiently improves the accuracy, quality, and speed of industrial operations. Defect Detection: Using computer vision for flaw detection in manufacturing. With fast inference speeds using edge AI and flexible training, computer vision can be applied across many manufacturing processes. Increased security in remote locations: Unmanned and remote locations such as oil wells can be monitored with computer vision.\\xa0Facial authentication\\xa0confirms the personnel’s identity to ensure only the right people have access to restricted areas. Improved workplace safety: Computer vision can detect required gear in images and video, to ensure that employees wear protective gloves and hard hats. This reduces the risk of workplace injuries and legal costs while improving employee safety . Predictive maintenance: Computer vision is increasingly employed to monitor the status and health of critical infrastructure . If a plant or tool fails, it can lead to costly delays. Computer vision enables\\xa0early discovery and preventive measures\\xa0– saving time and money. Learn more about Chooch’s AI Vision solutions for manufacturers . 4. Safety and security Having cameras monitoring high-security facilities is not enough; if there is no way to analyze the imagery, it is of no use. Computer vision solves this, enabling advanced analysis of the data from surveillance technology. Facial authentication protects restricted areas: Adding computer vision and biometrics replacing passwords, badges, PINs prevents the wrong people from getting access to high-security facilities and classified information. Compliance with regulations: Visual AI can monitor if workers wear protective clothing and set off alerts when non-compliance is detected. This means lower insurance, reduced costs, and less risk. Virus mitigation: The risk of spreading infectious diseases in public spaces can be reduced with computer vision that detects coughing, mask-wearing, and even fevers in the era of Covid-19 5. Digital media and entertainment Media industry players such as publishers, advertisers, and brands are increasingly using computer vision to improve their businesses. Automated image enrichment: Adding metadata to images, and tagging new photos, reduces the need for manual labor. Cloud deployment of AI to identify people and objects and deep tagging also saves time while enhancing inventory value. Quality control and compliance with regulations: On social media platforms and other websites, computer vision helps with image analysis and quality control. It alerts editors about blurred images, nudity, deep fakes, and banned content. Customized advertising: Vendors can benefit from contextual ad placement, and images and objects in videos can be tagged to increase searchability. 6. Geospatial AI The amount of imagery derived from satellites and UAVs is growing at an explosive rate. From agriculture, urban planning, and disaster relief to insurance, conservation and earth science, computer vision provides the means to analyze and use the imagery. Increased public safety with change detection: Computer vision trained to identify wildfires, water level changes, and industrial activity with high accuracy increases public safety. Alerts can be sent to decision-makers, enabling efficient and timely action. Efficient earth observation: Computer vision allows for the analysis of electro-optical, infrared, synthetic aperture radar, from any source. Deep-learning computer vision can monitor everything from urban development and climate change to population dynamics and agriculture,\\xa0helping us understand\\xa0the world we live in. Improved environmental epidemiology: As COVID 19 continues to affect every aspect of our lives, the study of environmental and exposure factors in epidemics has never been more top-of-mind. Computer vision provides the tools for collecting and processing a wide range of data points relevant in research and prevention work. Learn more about AI Vision for Geospatial applications. Conclusion In a world where the amount of visual data is exploding, computer vision has a wide range of use cases.

       "  'text': 'AI for Good: Emrah Gultekin on 880TheBiz Radio | Chooch Listen on Spotify “We’re gonna go pro-AI now. And, when we think about it, you know, we’ve been talking about all the status security, erasing the data, but what happens when your car is stolen, your child is kidnapped. Now, all of a sudden, artificial intelligence comes in handy. Right? It’s a catch 22, it’s a yin and yang of the world that we’re gonna have to figure out. We’re lucky we have Emrah on the phone with us right now. He’s the co-founder and CEO of Chooch Technologies and let me give you a quick synapsis before he’s on to explain it himself. This is computer vision that processes any visual data — microscopic to satellite, the CCTVs to medical imaging, drones, etc. And we’re really lucky to have him. I know he’s a really busy guy so let’s get right to it.” Corey Morgan: Hey Emrah, it’s Corey Morgan, co-host, how are you tonight? Emrah: Good. Good. How are you guys? Johnny Irish: Good. Good. Corey Morgan: Yeah, we’re literally having such a good conversation but it really has on being, you know, on the protection side of all this. And, uh, on the flip side, you’re gonna come in and say, “You know what, this is gonna change our world and it’s for the best.” So, please tell us what’s going on in your world and how you got involved with this really quickly. Emrah: Yeah, so privacy is definitely a concern and we’ve been talking about this for many, many years now and it keeps us up at night. But the fact is, AI is becoming part of our lives as we move forward. And when we do this Chooch AI, we’re a computer vision company . So what we do is we clone human-built intelligence into machines. So if you’re a biomedical expert and you’re looking at cells all day and counting them and trying to identify them. What we do is we take their capability of doing that and we put it into machines so we don’t have to do it anymore. And then we proliferate it so one person becomes, you know, a thousand or a million. We can basically proliferate it to infinity. And, similarly, with other things like aircraft engine parts. Basically, anything visual that humans do today, we can take and we can put into a machine. So that the machine tags the same way that a human would. So basically, this is what we’re doing. It’s real AI and we work with some of the major themes, either spacial or healthcare . We’re doing a lot of security and safety as well. Johnny Irish: So how would that work, like, say to combat wildfires? AI Detection of Wildfires Emrah: That’s one of our projects, actually. So today, wildfires are detected by humans. Basically, okay there seems to be fire somewhere and they see some smoke and it’s too late by that time, usually. So what we’re doing is we’re processing 30 million images every 15 minutes from satellites and drones so that we can send back that information to first responders and send them email alerts or text alerts. So, humanly impossible to do, you’d need thousands and thousands of people looking at this imagery to detect wildfires from space . And that’s basically what we’re doing to one of our major projects that we’ve been doing since 2018. Johnny Irish: Alright, you also mentioned healthcare . You know sometimes I feel like our audience are, you know, just the general public and doesn’t really know what’s going on behind the scenes. So it’s healthcare, it’s wildfires. What are the main AI technologies currently being developed to make us safer and help us move on a daily basis throughout our lives that we might not know about? Emrah: Yeah, so it’s really early in AI development to be perfectly straight-forward. It’s sort of akin to internet in 1993-1994. It’s just starting and you can browse two things but nothing substantial as it is today. AI is the same way. It’s very, very early. A lot of these components don’t work out of the box. So it’s not like, “Oh, AI is here.” It’s a new computational tool, basically, and it’s kind of horizontal today. So you take computer vision , for example, it’s kind of horizontal across verticals. And then, you also have other things like NLU, NLP which is Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding. And then, you have audio as well. You have speech. These are things that are being developed across as vertical as horizontally. And what we’re seeing is, you know, we’re seeing incremental increase in these. I think what we’re doing is this will be 20 to 30 years in development. And we’ll see it basically come into our lives very, very quickly in many different fields. We’re seeing it today in, for example, the home pods like Alexa and Google and whatever. We’re seeing it in self-driving cars. We’re seeing across some enterprise as well. So it’s not very consumer-y right now. And that’s why people, I think, are very confused about this. It’s more enterprise-y. And it’s across enterprises, their back ends using this technology to do better data analytics, data crunching across those different verticals. Johnny Irish: Uh, real quick here. Let’s just take a step backwards. Just a little one on one before we jump into some of the details. What is artificial intelligence exactly, and how does it differ from, like, machine learning ? Emrah: Great question. So, artificial intelligence is the entirety of a new computational method. Machine learning is one of the methods underneath artificial intelligence. So artificial intelligence is, it encompasses the entire gamut of this new computational method but machine learning is part of it. So if you’re talking technically, yes machine learning is the best way to talk about it. There are two components to machine learning: one is training, so you need to train an AI; and then, the second component are the predictions that are called inferencing . So if you don’t train the AI, you don’t get any inferencing predictions. So machine learning , it kinda branched out into two things there. To train it, you need to provide labeled images. And that’s what we do with Chooch AI , we provide, we labeled images saying, “Okay, this is a certain type of cell, or this is a certain type of acid on the ground.” And then, the AI learns it and when it receives new information, it can tag those things. Johnny Irish: Okay. Emrah: That’s really what AI is about today. It’s a regression tool. It’s not really artificial intelligence. That’s kind of a misnomer. Johnny Irish: Mhhm. Emrah: It’s a new computational tool. I wish they would have called it that because artificial intelligence gets people kind of edgy. Johnny Irish: Yeah, it’s like does artificial intelligence even exist? Corey Morgan: When you say artificial intelligence, I think Terminator, you know, literally. Emrah: Yeah, and that’s not where we are and I don’t think we’re gonna go there at all. Johnny Irish: Yeah, Skynet you know. *laughs* Emrah: Yeah, yeah. It’s a new computational tool and the computation is stronger than old computational tools which are like, you know, normal algorithms. What this does is, it does multiple algorithms in a linear regression so it can make predictions on certain things. And the prediction is just a tag, but it’s just a computation. It’s a computer. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And so, personally we’re practitioners in AI and we’re saying there’s nothing to be afraid of here at this stage because this is just a new way of computing and, actually, we have no choice. It’s like rejecting electricity or rejecting a car, like, “I’m not gonna drive a car.” Johnny Irish: Yeah, right. And that happened back in the day, by the way folks. *laughs* Emrah: Yeah. Yeah. Johnny Irish: People were against electricity. I mean, people are against cars and they wanted to keep the horse and buggy. Corey Morgan: Yeah, and to be honest with you, it’s like rejecting the internet, as you said, in ’93, ’94. Johnny Irish: Exactly. Emrah: Yeah, it is. We have no choice as humans, as, like, in this community, this country, the world. Because if we don’t take this on, like, there’s competition. This is all about efficiency, and if we don’t become more efficient, others will. And we’ll lose. Johnny Irish: And when you say that, you’re not talking about corporations. You’re talking about continents and countries. Corey Morgan: We’re trying to be the AI superpower. A lot of people think they are and they’re gonna take our technology and move on. Emrah: Exactly. It’s between countries. It’s between communities. It’s between organizations, companies. Companies, especially, they need to be much more efficient. Johnny Irish: Mhhm. Emrah: Those who become efficient will take over the market. And that’s why you see this race with self-driving cars. Right? Johnny Irish: Mhmm. Emrah: Where you have, like, people pouring billions into self-driving because the moment you have a self-driving car, you’ve taken over that market and you’ve taken over the entire market as well. Johnny Irish: Yeah, so we have touched on this and, not to take you off topic, we have touched on this a couple of shows ago regarding the self-driving cars and the technology, the infrastructure on the actual highways where the cars can talk to each other, you know, like, “this car just switched lanes.” It becomes much more than the car, in my opinion, it becomes the environment that the car is driving in. And that has to be “smart”, for lack of a better word, as well. Like a smart highway. Am I wrong in that? Emrah: It’s correct. So what we’re doing on the self-driving car, part of this, a lot of this is usually AI as well. So remember, you have to teach the car what’s allowed. What do the pedestrian look like? What’s the “Stop” sign? What’s a tree? Is it a rabbit or is it a cat? I mean, it may not make a difference, but the more detail you have, the better it can discern between things. Smarter Cars with AI So these cars that you see, they’re collecting information, visual data. And that visual data are annotated, labeled, and it goes into a training system. And then the training system goes back and it’s deployed into the cars. So it’s like this circular thing. And right, the highways need to be smarter but it’s really the cars that need to be a lot smarter and need to be talking to each other. And that, that exists today. The science of that exists. The problem is, how do you get that to the engineering? And then, how do you make a product out of it and how do you distribute it? Johnny Irish: Yeah. Emrah: So the science of this had existed for about 34 years but it’s nothing near. But how do you really deploy it? How do you engineer it and then you create a product? Johnny Irish: Yeah. How do we perfect it at this point? Emrah: Exactly. Exactly. Johnny Irish: You know, one thing we’ve been, you know, and this is how, why we were introduced. And the point of tonight’s show and the individual segments is, we came into this as, you know, everyone’s collecting our data and how do we do. But, one thing that we had a discussion, you know, Matt and I, my board up here, we were just talking about it and we mentioned it on the earlier segment is in regards to Alexa. Even though she’s listening to you, she’s not listening because it’s an evil thing. She’s listening because she need to learn those words. It’s more educational for her than data sharing. Am I correct with that? Emrah: It is. It is. And unfortunately, we have this stigma against AI because we called AI and that’s not what’s happening here. Of course what happens is, it’s a very powerful tool, right? And so what people are really afraid of here is some people having access to it and others don’t. So it’s kinda like the “have” and the “have not”, and the have’s trying to take over the world and do evil things. And what we really need to do is create equality on the availability of AI to everybody. And that you need some sort of checks and balances there so that okay I have this tool but okay my neighbor also has it. Johnny Irish: Yeah. Emrah: There’s a certain check there. And I think that, honestly, it’s totally, totally for efficiency. We are highly inefficient right now. We need to become more efficient, which means creating more welfare. It creates more welfare for everybody. Johnny Irish: Mhhm. Emrah: I’ll go back to this thing where London has 500,000 CCTVs. Johnny Irish: Yeah. Yeah. Emrah: 500,000 cameras. New York has 9000. I’m like, “Why did that happen?” Well, it’s because of the IRA. Safety with Facial Authentication Johnny Irish: Ugh. You’ve read my mind. You’ve read my mind. Emrah: Right. And they go, “Hey listen, I’m gonna put up these cameras.” They put up the cameras, the bombing stopped. I’d rather have a camera than a bomb in my neighborhood. That’s really the reality here. And whether they are viewing us, or, like, listening that’s a different case but I think, those types of stories we need to put out there so that people feel safer and adapt. Johnny Irish: Yeah, I don’t really want to get into the CCTV thing because that where we’ll get into facial recognition and that brings us back on the negative side, too much information and lack of privacy. But on the pro side, and this is my opinion and what I would see would be valuable for the world and our country and municipalities. When you have the likes of a Tesla, doing what they’re doing. Now, everyone else is trying to catch up – Ford, Hyundai. I think that information, even though these companies are competing with each other for consumer, for self-driving car, or that I can park itself, or, you know, it’s gonna automatically slow down. I think, all that data that it collects should be open source because, guess what, we just collected all that data and it’s good for the consumers so Ford can use it too, you know? Emrah: Yeah, and a lot of these companies are doing that. So you have OpenAI, for example, and that is like a consolidation of all these different tools and information and data that people collect from different companies and Tesla’s actually a part of it. At Chooch, we’re also opening up our dataset so we have 200,000 pre-training qualifications, we have over 150 models running and that’s also open to the public. So you’re right about that, that it should be public. I think we should go back to its equity. Johnny Irish: Yeah. I mean, it should be mandatory from the government, you know what, you collected all this data with a consumers’ car that you’re just accessing. It’s not even your own car anymore, you sold it. And that should just be, you know, I’m not saying to reveal trade secrets but if there’s a pothole on the 836, share it to the Ford and Hyundai people. Emrah: Everyone should know. Everyone should know Johnny Irish: Yeah. Emrah: There’s positive externalities on that and that creates welfare for everybody. Johnny Irish: I have a quick question, Emrah: Yeah. Johnny Irish: Why Chooch (kh-ootsh) ? How did you come up with the name Chooch (kh-ootsh) ? Emrah: It’s Chooch (tsh-ootsh) actually. Johnny Irish: I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Emrah: *laughs* Khooch is something else but Chooch is a mixture of choose and search. Johnny Irish: Aaahh. Emrah: It’s actually the future of search and because we’re gonna have these glasses on the future and that would be able to understand what’s happening around you in more detail so you look at something you’re eating and it’ll tell you how many calories there is in it and what’s in it. And you’ll look at, like, a car and it’ll tell you where you can buy it or, like, all the details of it. Johnny Irish: Yeah. Yeah. Emrah: So it’s kind of like the future of search and it also means dummy, idiot in Italian dialect. Johnny Irish: Those are the people that say it wrong, though, right? *laughs* *everyone laughs* Emrah: And AI is a dummy. It’s a poor reflection of humanity and there’s also that kind of play on words on that so that’s why we called it Chooch. Johnny Irish: So let me ask you a question, I hate to say artificial intelligence, can computational intelligence compete with human intelligence and/or what are the ways that they can’t? What are we finding out? Emrah: Yeah, great question. So what we’re looking at here is very basic computational capability that’s akin to human understanding but very, very light. So to your nose, “Oh, this is an apple”, “This is a pear.” That’s all it does is it tags. The way it becomes more intelligent than a human is because it works 24/7 and you can proliferate it. So that’s where the whole thing is. It’s not smarter than a human but it works 24/7 and you can just basically, like, it scales to infinity. That’s where it’s better than a human, better than human. It’s like a calculator, you know. Humans know how to calculate to but it takes us some time to do it and, you know, one person at a time, well we can do one topic at a time. Here, you have these can basically put in 0.01 seconds and, like, it’s all over the place. So in that sense, much better than a human. On the other hand, it’s not really that deep and intelligent because, I mean, we’re very, very complex beings. What the machine is doing is basically one or two layers of computational understanding and we’re nowhere near that, probably not for the next 70,70, hundred years. Johnny Irish: It only knows what you feed it, for the most part. Correct? So behind it, there’s always somebody putting data into it? Emrah: Exactly. There’s a human putting data into it or some stream of data coming in and it’s not intelligent in the way it assesses it. It just gives you tags or, like, alerts. It doesn’t really understand context that well. There isn’t that type of understanding. So, you don’t have to be afraid of that. What we have to be concerned about is, okay well, you can do this but this AI can be like, you can basically scale it too infinity now. Johnny Irish: How do you think quantum computing is gonna change that? Emrah: Quantum computing is interesting and we’re in the very early stages of that too. Remember, AI, all these deep learning frameworks, machine learning , they require a lot of compute power and this compute power didn’t exist 5 year ago. This is very, very new. And it came on with the GPU servers, which are graphic processing units of NVIDIA. They’re basically used for gaming. They develop these chips for gaming. And suddenly, they saw, well this is interesting, we can also use it for these types of computations. So that kind of increased the onboarding of AI, so that one with the GPUs and the next stage of this would the quantum computing. So if I want to run millions of models at the same time, then, you know, you’ll need that type of compute power to do that. That’s one of the limiting factors today. Many, many layers of computation that for you to do it, Chooch AI would do image quantification, object detection, segmentation, facial recognition , authentication and all that kind of stuff. You put these in layers and you put it on a machine, it’s very heavy for the machine. So to be able to get to the next level of that, yes quantum computers are gonna be crucial for better AI. Johnny Irish: Now, tell us about your company a little. Who is your target audience? Are you government? Main industry? I mean, I doubt, you know, the regular guy would call you up. Or are you more of research and development? How does it work? Emrah: Yeah. We’re a B-B enterprise. So we’re based of Silicon Valley, what we do is we clone human visual intelligence into machine. And that’s across many, many verticals so we do have government clients, but we also have many, many commercial clients as well. And a lot of our clients are looking for these types of solutions to increase the efficiency of what they’re doing. So let’s say, you know, checking and understanding movements in operating room, basically for compliance for safety. Does everyone have their hard hats on? Does everyone have their gloves on? And it’s stuff like that where you have compliance issues, so we’re working on a lot with that and also researches for client discovery as well. So basically being able to understand the different cells. What’s happening in these biomedical labs and understanding the interaction between different elements over there. So, it’s really B to B, healthcare , government, spacial, and security and safety , it’s really what we do. Johnny Irish: So you guys do a lot of reaching out to these organizations saying, “You know what guys, here’s the technology that you need.” Compared to them saying, “Hey, you have anything new today?” Am I correct with that? Emrah: Well, it’s usually people approach us with their problems already. Saying, “Uh we have a defined issue.” Like, “Hey, I wanna speed up the checking process,” “Hey, I need my OSHA compliance.” Or, you know, “People, I need to make sure are wearing their hard hats.” Better Surgical Outcomes with AI Johnny Irish: Let’s take a step back on that note. Sorry, I just want to take a step back because one thing you briefly mentioned that I was intrigued about was movements in surgery room. Emrah: Yeah. Yeah. So when does the surgeon walk in? When does the patient come in? When does anesthesia start? Stop? What goes into the surgical cavity? What comes out? So all that kind of stuff is what we’re doing as well. Yeah. And it’s more compliant and also assuring best practice so you might say, okay, we collect all these data, and then they do number crunching on them and then basically say, “Hey there’s something going on here which can be practiced all over the place.” So, we’re able to understand those points and to bring it to the market. Johnny Irish: Yeah, and I know a lot are already into this, you know, our guys in the North East, as soon as you mentioned OSHA, it’s Ah. Gotyah. *laughs* Corey Morgan: *laughs* Yeah. “Now we need you, how do we get hold of you?” *all laugh* Johnny Irish: Fellas, we’re running out of time here. We definitely want to have you back on as all our clients, Corey, I and Matt and this station itself were very lucky to get very educated individuals and successful people like yourself. But for the audience, our OSHA customers, and listeners, how do they get a hold of you? And you know, tell us, the floor is yours for a minute to just tell everyone who you are, what you do and how to find you. Emrah: Yeah. So, uh, thank you guys for this. Basically, we’re Chooch AI. We’re a visual AI company. We clone visual human intelligence into machines so that humans don’t need to do it anymore and basically get more work done doing it. We’re Silicon Valley based.

Our AI model associated with social distancing has several benefits. It reduces the costs associated with COVID-19 infection, lowers risk for people in the area, ensures legal compliance, and helps save lives. Social distancing AI uses the following methods: Chooch AI trains AI models to measure the distance between two people. We set parameters to determine whether the distance is safe. Intelligent video analytics work with existing video systems to detect the distance between two or more people in the video feed. It’s easy to add Chooch AI to edge devices and cameras. The visual AI from Chooch can accurately detect if there is social distancing between the people in the video feed. If not, we send an alert to relevant personnel. Social distancing AI is crucial in ensuring public health safety in areas that have the potential to be crowded, such as offices, malls, train stations, busy streets, schools, and airports. After we have deployed a social distancing AI model , Chooch AI provides remote training and computer vision consulting. If a partner has specific needs, we can deploy a custom model.

       "  'text': 'Chooch AI Vision Studio Product Update | Chooch The computer vision platform at Chooch AI is scaling with our customer and partner engagement. In this webinar, we introduce an updated dashboard offering analytics, alerts, and insights. Read the entire Chooch AI Product Update webinar below. Learn more about our computer vision platform from the Product page. \\ufeff Here’s the transcript. Vina: Our API is organized around REST API. This allows our developers to programmatically communicate back and forth with our platform, but it’s just as easy to use as our UI. And also our API is compatible with live streams and live tagging, which is done through the user’s edge device, which brings up our next slide. When we talk about edge device, we refer to a locally placed server that you can run AI models on, which is OnPrem, not in the cloud and close to a video feed. On the dashboard view, there’s a list of devices ready for you to access. Within edge devices, you can manage your own camera streams, set up new devices, and deploy AI models. With edge devices, this is very useful when it comes to increasing privacy and security, since it is locally stored and it’s not in the cloud. So what are some of these models, you’re asking? Our next slide for public models, Chooch has developed these models that allow you to quickly detect any object that you were looking for. Some examples of these public models is fire detection. Here in California, as we all know, we do have a lot of fires, especially detecting those small fires before it becomes massive fires. And then also we do smoke detection , which goes hand in hand with fire detection, as you can probably detect smoke before you can detect the fire. PPE detection, I think that’s really valuable, right now, especially in the workplace, making sure that your employees are wearing hard hats or safety vests or gloves, or even at the airports wearing a mask. PPE detection is very valuable right now during this pandemic. We also have human fall detection , right? Making sure that you’re detecting, if your employee has fallen in the workplace, what type of actions do you need to take and also how to prevent that from happening again. So now that you’ve seen our public models, let me show you some of our dataset tools in our next slide. With dataset you can create your own custom models. As you can see here, we have some airplanes, which is part of our object detection model. So 2D and 3D synthetic data. This is really helpful in helping generate different image viewpoints, object poses, backgrounds, and lighting conditions.\\xa0As you can see in that screenshot, the airplane is seen in the daytime and also at night. So that’s different lighting conditions, and for generating different angles, such as like tools and machinery to identify different components and different parts of those tools or machinery. 2D and 3D synthetic data can also be really helpful in enhancing your dataset with images that are less common or hard to find. With smart annotations, you can use custom or public models to annotate additional objects within a dataset. Let’s just say you have a thousand images within your dataset, smart annotation will make it easier to detect those additional objects. With augmentation, you can make slight modifications to your images in a dataset by rotating, scaling, or cropping, as you can see the image of that airplane, there’s different angles. Also with data augmentation Chooch provides the ability to copy and modify 2D objects, hundreds of times, to train the AI faster. Lastly, our next slide we’ll do a high level overview of some of our version four updates. So I’ll just highlight that now we have Kubernetes deployment, that’s supported. Our average inference speed has increased up to two times, and so this means that for a basic AI model, you can do 10 predictions within one second. We also support live streams from YouTube and M3U playlists, and we’ve also improve multiple streaming and inference features. So I’ll go ahead and pass this on to Peter who will now discuss more about our new analytics feature. Thank you. Peter: Thank you very much, Vina for that. Again, this is Peter now. Again, we’re going to go and talk a little bit more about the new analytics interface as well as our alerting configuration options, being able to change or manipulate, or provide a workflow on intelligence on what is and is not alarming from the system. From here we have on our analytic interface, we have the ability to view different predictions in the system. This again is a way to look at them in different graph or graphing interfaces, filtering them based on time or feed or model, and then also being able to manipulate based on time. Okay, so here we see some examples of the different interface. On the top, we have our different filtering options. Again, we can choose based on device, so different edge component, which we’ll go in a little bit later. Per stream or camera stream, that’s our terminology for that. Different zones, which we’ll go out in a second again. Hey, different geofences within a video feed. Hey, loading dock, or another part of the interface, and then also events. So hey, I want to see only certain events. On the top right we can also see the different filtering on time. So instead of looking at it for all of time, maybe the last month or the last week, again, being able to filter and dial in this information within our interface. As you make these changes, you can see on the bottom an example of the line graph, but again, this can be changed. We can also see pie graphs or other manipulations like that. And as part of this interface, we also are able to see the actual event or alert image as well. So for example, the first three pictures there, we see a geofence or zone, where a forklift or a person triggered that specific event in the system. And again, we grab a snapshot from that video feed and store it in the solution, and then for the other pictures there, we see an example of a retail situation where maybe a geofence or zone is drawn around a specific kiosk that we want to monitor activities there. So hey, a person came there, maybe they dwelled more than 60 seconds, again, we’re able to data mine that as part of our analytics here. Okay, the next thing here is we’re going to look and talk about our rules interface. So now we’re able to provide a workflow or filtering methodology to define not only when do we get predictions, but then based on certain criteria. And so the first event here is, hey, from a model that we saw going to talk about our earlier, where we have some models that have upwards of a thousand different predictions in it, or again, if you create your own model yourself, you can go ahead and define that. But hey, within this interface, I only want to go ahead and look for the packages as part of a certain model. And so, hey, the first tab here is we define what annotation or label we want to grab from them. And then the next tab… We see, hey, not only do we want to see its physic model triggered based on this prediction, but also a geofence. So in this example here, there’s this zone that was drawn around a loading dock, so when we see in this example here again, not packages, but hey, when a forklift comes into that zone, we want to get an alarm. And then on the last one we have rules. And so in here within these different components, we’re able to also define temporal presence, proximity, and zones, which we saw a second ago. So temporal is time, presence is the amount of people or objects in that area, proximity is distance between, so like social distancing, like what we’re dealing with right now, and then lastly zones. So zone again, we saw it earlier. So what this ultimately means is all the different criteria between events, zones, and rules, would then trigger an event in our system. So we’re trying to filter out the noise, making things only pertinent based on what is actionable, based on the custom use case, things like that. And then we’ll pass on over to Omid to do a live demo of the system. Thank you very much. Omid: Awesome, thank you for that. Let me go ahead, share my screen. All right. All right, so we’re going to begin off with the dashboard. So this is the landing page when you first log into your Chooch dashboard. You’re going to see all of your API documentations , our platform guides , and our how-to videos right here on the right-hand side, and then you’ll also see quick navigational access on the top-hand side. If you scroll down to the bottom, you’ll see all of our latest updates, so what’s changed on the platform, and anytime we make new updates, you’ll be able to see that there as well as our API key. Now just kind of re-highlighting some of the points that our team has talked about. We want to touch on some of the public models real quick, so I can come here and we can go to our object detection models. And here again is where you can quickly leverage our pre-built models out of the box. So there’s no customized development needed. These are ready to go. You can push these to your devices and be able to use them rapidly. You can note that some are very lightweight, they’ll have two classifications and I’ll get into what that means, but basically fall down or standing, and then we have some models that have over 11,000 classifications, like our general deep detection. So this is leveraging and detecting everything from phones to cells, to different actions like swimming, biking, climbing, it incorporates all these all into this one large model. Now there’s a lot of instances where users or customers may need their own custom developed model. So what we allow users to do is to develop those models, and our own team actually leverages as these tools in-house. So if we go to our datasets tab here and we go to my object datasets… Here, you can see some models that we have started, some datasets that we have started annotating ourselves. And if you already have previously annotated datasets, what you can do is just hit upload dataset and upload that dataset as long as it’s in the COCO JSON format, with all the supporting images with it. Now I’m going to touch on this dataset here. This is one that we can all easily relate to, and it’s just on airplanes. Now, what you can see here is we have over 1,700 different images already loaded and annotated on this platform. Now, if you’re doing this manually image per image, that can take a long time and sometimes you may not have all of those images readily available. So what our platform allows you to do is to upload limited amount of data, and then use the additional tools to generate larger amounts of data to be used for model training. And just to give you a reference with these 1,700 images that are already annotated and produced here, we only use 30 real images, one 35 second video clip, and one CAD file. And with that, we’re able to do things like generating synthetic data. So 3D synthetic data, you would upload your CAD file and then a material file with it, and then Chooch would be able to apply either your specific backgrounds or we have generic backgrounds that we could apply to it, to then generate vast amounts of data. 2D Synthetic data is basically once you annotate an object, you can then apply your own backgrounds and themes, and then Chooch starts randomizing and making additional images from your data already. And then we have things like smart annotation, so that’s going through and automatically labeling a lot of these. So if you already have, let’s say 30 aircrafts, you can go through smart annotation and be able to automatically let the system annotate all those aircrafts for you. And then the last thing is I call it the knockout punch, is using augmentation. What augmentation will do, it’ll take all those images and then apply either rotational or horizontal flips, then start adding additional, basically shifting scaling rotation, noise, blur, and brightness, and contrast to the images that are being generated, to allow for different environmental considerations. Now, just to show you what our annotation tool looks like, I’ll go into this image real quick… And here you can see this is going to be a no-code approach to labeling and annotating. So all we’re doing is taking this tool and actually drawing our bounding box around this aircraft. So we can just click drag and draw, and then we can label it as a 747, and once we hit save, you’ll see this number actually increase. Now we have 1,772 images , as well as annotations. And just to give you an idea of what the 2D synthetic looks like, so this aircraft is labeled and facing the left. Now, if I go to the next image, you’ll see the same aircraft is just resized facing the opposite direction with a different background now applied to it. So these are the ways and methods that we’re able to now generate larger amounts of data, so you can create a strong model. Now, once your data is annotated and ready to go, what you can do is just hit, create model, give it a name and then hit create. And once we hit create, Chooch is going to take this internally and start running through and building a model for us. So now what we can do is once we have these models developed and they’re built in-house with your annotations and your maybe data scientists applying their knowledge into it… And again, this can be anything from detecting objects or detecting anything from, let’s say, cancer or bacteria cells on X-ray visions. So it’s basically taking the expertise of an individual, like a doctor, and applying it to the AI. And once we build the model, then you can go to your devices. So in creating the devices, very simple and easy, as long as you meet some of our basic criteria, you’ll see here, you’ll be able to run on Ubuntu and Red Hat, you’ll be a select your GPU, and then if you leverage MQTT for machine-to-machine communication, you can also do that, so when we generate any detections, we can send it to that MQTT broker to then distribute as you have defined it. So in this case, we already have a device created and we’re running on a T4 GPU. And when we come in, we can now apply different streams. So adding a stream is fairly simple, you’d hit add stream, give it a name, and let’s call this… Airport runway, and then you would give it an IP. We’ll just give it a blank IP here, and we’ll hit add string. So now this new stream data has been added. And then you can go into this stream and apply a model. So if we go into one, like our smart loading example, we already have a forklift custom model built, but if we wanted to, we can add additional models to it, so we’re not limiting you on the amount of models that you can add per stream. So let’s see what this actually looks like. So this new screen I just came into is our edge dashboard. This edge capability can be in your private cloud, it can be on premise, or you can also leverage our cloud as well. Now here, you’re seeing all the different people, forklifts, boxes, and packages being annotated and detected here, and you’re seeing everything in red. Those are all the current objects and people that are being detected. Now we want to take it to another level and apply some additional analytics to this. So if we come back to our dashboard here, we can go to our analytics settings… And here’s where we start defining our different classes and groups. So now we can additionally group person and forklift together. So you can create a group like we have done here, and then we can go to our zones tab. So these are all like Peter was mentioning earlier, we can annotate different zones. So in this case, on our zone map, you can see we have an unloading zone and then we have a loading zone. So once you use, and it’s the same tooling that you saw before for doing the annotation, it’s just a no-code approach. We can then go to rules. So in this rule, we have defined danger zone. So it’s a person, forklift, and the unloading zone together for more than one second, then we will generate an alert. So if we go back to our devices, what users can additionally do is be alerted either in real time, or select a different frequency. So here you can see that I’ve applied my email to this alert and reports email, and frequency, you can do either real time, you can do end of hour, end of day, end of week, or end of month, and then you can include the alert images in those as reports as well. So if we go to our analytics tab now… Navigate here… What the system will do now is gather all of the alerts that it has detected, and be able to show us in a graph format or in pie charts, right? And as Peter mentioned, and you can start toggling and applying different filters, so if you have an incident and you want to drill down to say, “Hey, I need to go back to this day, at this hour, on this specific camera,” you can now filter that and quickly access some of the analytics behind it. So here you can see the pie charts with all of our forklifts, our smart loading… And then if we actually go to alert images, you can actually get a snapshot view of some of those alerts that have occurred. So in this case, in our forklift danger, we have a person that’s very close to the forklift and one of the zones. So we’re able to highlight that as well. And what this would look like in the email, if I go back here, you go to our emails, you’ll see that in the email, you can get an alert for the specific device, the stream, the date and time, as well as some of the rules that were triggered here. And then you’ll get again, the snapshot of that incident or that alert or that rule being broken. So with that, I will stop sharing and hand it back over to Andrew. Andrew: Thanks Omid, and thanks to our entire Chooch team for the efforts on those updates. Now, we will open it up for Q&A. We’ll take a brief 30 seconds and let everyone enter any questions on the chat below, and we actually had a couple that just came in and we’ll kick it off and as questions come in we will tackle those. So our first question is, how long does a typical model take to develop? Omid: Yes, I can go ahead and answer that one, Andrew. So typical models can vary on timelines. That variation can be on the amount of data being supplied and the complexity in which we’re tackling. Now, traditionally, a typical model can take between six months to a year to develop, but with the tools that we show today, you can rapidly develop models and being very conservative in a matter of a couple of weeks. And that’s with a lot of testing being done and making sure that the accuracy is where we would like it to be. That’s a good question. Andrew: Yeah, great question. Great question. Another question we have regarding models is, do you all build models or provide just professional services? Peter: I can go ahead and take that one. So great question as well. So we provide either two options here, either we can provide the services for you to do the development and training of a model. We can also train the trainer where we can help provide mentoring or consulting services to use the platform, or the platform as itself, as you saw from Omid’s demonstration is with a little guidance and documentation and self explanatory, where you can potentially do the model development yourself as well. So depending upon the business model and the needs and how complex use cases, we can enter either all three possible pursuits. Thank you. Andrew: Awesome, thanks Peter. Another question regarding the private cloud, can you be installed on my private cloud? Peter: I’ll take that one as well. Our solution is very flexible in that it can be deployed a hundred percent in the cloud, or there could be also what we call the edge component OnPrem, but the edge component can also deployed in your cloud as well, so we’re very dynamic to what can deployed and where it is. We can try and explore that further based on exactly what would be the required compute and things like that. Andrew: Exactly. Thanks Peter. This one’s regarding alerts. Funny timing, right after you Peter, does our platform have the ability to send out SMS alerts, not just email alerts? Peter: Yep, and I’ll grab that one as well. So in addition to email and SMS, be it reports or alerts, we do support MQTT integration as well. And so that’s a standard within the IoT or OnPrem interface and industry, so we can integrate to an MQTT broker and then provide our predictions via JSON or things like that. Thank you. Andrew: Awesome, thanks Peter. Another one that we have here is how many public models does Chooch currently have available to customers? So I can kind of tag this one, we have over 250,000 models and it really comes down to, with our team, with the rapid model development. That’s how we have come to this number. I think we got time for maybe a couple more here as we keep going through here. Oh, someone’s done their homework. You did not mention anything about the IC2 app. Can you talk a little bit more about the IC2 app and how it connects with public models? Peter: One minor correction to what you just said, Andrew, it actually classifications or annotations. So that means, hey, we’re able to look for smoke, car, wave, boat, et cetera, but we have upwards about 80 different models, varying from image, object detection, facial detection, and also text detection. We have up to 250,000 different type of classes for those detections. Going to your second question there, Andrew, thank you for that in regards to IC2. So the IC2 mobile app, be it for Android or Apple is a way to demonstrate and test out our general deep detection, analytic, or model we have in our solution. And so what this does is you’re providing a camera interface, looking at different things. My picture on my wall here, myself, or another person next to me, it’s providing images up to our cloud and we’re providing general detection looking at a person’s gender or age or sentiment or things like that. So again, it’s a way to test out and demonstrate the power of our product. Omid: I just wanted to add to that with the IC2 , we’re constantly developing and iterating on it. And now what we’re also able to do is annotate on the fly. So you could be out in the field somewhere and you need to make an annotation. You can grab an image of it, annotate it, and it’ll actually get pushed up to your cloud dataset. So in your dataset, you’ll have an actual tag there for your IC2 app , and then all the images that you annotate on your phone through the IC2 app will get generated there, so you can incorporate that into your larger datasets. Andrew: Absolutely. And thanks Peter, for the clarification on that one. We got time for one more question here. Does Chooch AI offer pilots to companies, and how long is a typical pilot? We can kind of tag team this one. A pilot or a kickstart can vary anywhere from weeks to months, but the short answer is yes, we do offer that, and would love to talk to you more about how this works with you and scope this process with you. Absolutely, we do. Any team members have anything else to add on that? Peter: Yeah, and I’ll jump in there as well. And again, the pilot is dependent upon the use case, the model to be developed, and just also how ROI or return on investment is measured on that. But ultimately it’s on a case by case basis, and within the timeframe kind of what Andrew budgeted there. Andrew: Absolutely. Well, we are our running short of time here. We try to get to all the questions. Those that we did not, we’ll try to get back to you via this chat. Thank you all for joining today, and please feel to reach out to us at chooch.ai, and we look forward to communicating with you and answering more of your questions. Thanks so much for joining us today, have a great rest of your day. Peter: Thank you very much, everyone. Share Featured Articles Edge AI When is the Right Time to Deploy Edge Computing?

       "  'text': 'What’s the Difference Between Object & Image Recognition? | Chooch Object recognition is a subfield of computer vision , artificial intelligence, and machine learning that seeks to recognize and identify the most prominent objects (i.e., people or things) in a digital image or video with AI models . Image recognition is also a subfield of AI and computer vision that seeks to recognize the high level contents of an image. How Is Object Recognition Different from Image Recognition? If you’re familiar with the domain of computer vision, you might think that object recognition sounds very similar to a related task: image recognition . However, there’s a subtle yet important difference between image recognition and object recognition: In image recognition , the AI model assigns a single high-level label to an image or video. In object recognition , the AI model identifies each and every noteworthy object in the image or video. The best way to illustrate the difference between object recognition and image recognition is through an example. Given a photograph of a soccer game, an image recognition model would return a single label such as “soccer game.” An object recognition model, on the other hand, would return many different labels corresponding to the different objects (e.g., the players, the soccer ball, the goal, etc.), as well as their positions in the image. Object recognition is also not quite the same as another computer vision task called object detection: Object recognition models are given an image or video, with the task of identifying all the relevant objects in it. Object detection models are given an image or video as well as an object class, with the task of identifying all the occurrences of that object (and only that object). For example, suppose you have an image of a street scene: An object detection model would take this image as input as well as an object class such as “pedestrian” or “car,” and then return all the detected locations in the image where that object occurs. An object recognition model, on the other hand, would return the locations of both pedestrians and cars, as well as all other objects it recognizes in the image (buildings, street signs, etc.). You can therefore think of object detection as a “filter” on the output of general object recognition models, looking only for a specific type of object. How Are Object Recognition Models Trained? To perform object recognition, machine learning experts train AI models on extremely large datasets of labeled data. Each member of the dataset includes the source image or video, together with a list of the objects it contains and their positions (in terms of their pixel coordinates). By “studying” this dataset and learning from its mistakes, the AI model gradually improves its capability to recognize different classes of objects during AI training , just as humans learn to recognize different visual concepts. Once the model has been trained on a preexisting dataset, it can start analyzing fresh real-world input. For each image or video frame, the model creates a list of predictions for the objects it contains and their locations. Each prediction is assigned a confidence level—i.e., how much the model believes the prediction represents a real-world object. Predictions that are above a given threshold are classified as objects, and they become the final output of the system. How Are Image Recognition Models Trained? The AI model training process for image recognition is similar to that of object recognition. However, there’s one crucial difference: the labels for the input dataset. Object recognition datasets bundle together an image or video with a list of objects it contains and their locations. Image recognition datasets, however, bundle together an image or video with its high-level description. Before training an image recognition model , machine learning experts need to decide which categories they would like the AI model to recognize. For example, a simple weather recognition model might classify images as “sunny,” “cloudy,” “rainy,” or “snowy.” Each image or video in the training dataset needs to be associated with one of these labels, so that the model can learn it during the training process. Once the image recognition model is trained, it can start analyzing real-world data. The model accepts an image as input, and returns a list of predictions for the image’s label. As with object recognition, each prediction has a confidence level. The prediction with the highest confidence level is selected as the system’s final output. What Is Object Recognition Used for? Object recognition has many practical use cases. Below are just a few applications of object recognition: In retail AI , object recognition models can identify different products and brands on the shelves to analyze how customers interact with and purchase them. In geospatial AI , wildlife researchers can use object recognition on drone footage to analyze how animal populations change in an area over time. In media AI , sales and marketing professionals can use object recognition to identify “objects” such as logos, brands, and products to better understand the contents of an image. Autonomous vehicles require object recognition to identify the most relevant parts of the world around them (e.g., pedestrians, road signs, or other cars). Facial authentication can also be considered a special case of object recognition in which a person’s face is the “object” that must be detected. Modern facial recognition systems can detect thousands of different faces with extremely high accuracy in just a fraction of a second. What is Image Recognition Used For? Like object recognition, image recognition is used in a wide variety of industries and applications. Below are some examples: In manufacturing AI , image recognition models can examine products and classify them as “defective” or “non-defective.” In security AI , construction sites can use image recognition to make sure that workers are wearing their personal protective equipment (PPE), classifying surveillance images as “compliant” or “non-compliant.” ( Click here to see a video of a PPE detection model in action.) In healthcare AI , physicians can use image recognition models to analyze the output of medical imaging devices. For example, an AI trained on mammogram images can classify the machine’s output as “benign” or “potentially cancerous,” flagging it for review by a human expert.

       "  'text': 'AI Platforms | Flexible, Expandable and Agile | Chooch As artificial intelligence technologies continue to develop and advance with the advances in deep learning and more powerful GPUs, businesses are taking notice. But deciding to use enterprise AI solutions is just the tip of the iceberg—in particular, you need to decide between a single-purpose AI system vs. an AI platform. In this article, we’ll discuss why AI platforms are generally more flexible, expandable, and agile than alternatives such as a single-purpose AI system. According to a 2019 survey, 71 percent of organizations say that they plan to use more AI and machine learning in the near future, but we at Chooch AI believe that an AI platform is far preferable to a single-purpose AI system. What is a single-purpose AI system? A single-purpose AI system is just what it sounds like: an AI system that has been built for a single use case. This system may have been built internally, or by a third-party team of AI experts. What is an AI platform? An Enterprise AI Platform is a flexible, extensible framework. A platform makes it easier for businesses to develop solutions and applications using artificial intelligence. These platforms usually include assets such as AI algorithms, pre-trained models, datasets, and/or simple visual interfaces. Many AI platforms have prebuilt workflows for highly common use cases such as facial recognition, object recognition, and recommender systems. It’s free to try to Chooch AI Platform. AI platforms vs. single-purpose systems When you need a solution to a pressing business problem, developers’ first thought is often building a single-purpose AI system. In the same vein, entrepreneurs often have a single motivating idea or application that compels them to launch a startup in the field of AI. It’s true that the domain expertise of a single-purpose AI system (e.g. visual inspection) or service (e.g. data labeling for autonomous driving) should inform your planning, training data, model, and deployment. However, if you ask the author of e.g. a facial recognition system to reapply the product to another domain, such as e.g. identifying and counting cells, it might be nearly as time-consuming as building a new AI system from scratch. This is the biggest problem with a single-purpose AI system: it can be extremely inflexible and unable to adapt to change as your organization grows and evolves. An AI platform, on the other hand, is intended to be suitable for a wide variety of possible use cases. This means that such a platform has to be built to adapt, expand, and extend itself over time. For larger organizations, or for organizations who anticipate making changes in the future, enterprise AI platforms make far more sense. The functions of an AI platform In order to be truly effective as a standalone entity, AI platforms need to wear many different hats. The various functions of a well-rounded AI platform are: Data collection: AI models need vast quantities of data in order to function at peak performance—the more of it the better. Using an AI platform can help automate much of the data collection and organization process. Annotation labeling: Most organizations use AI to perform “supervised learning”: learning from examples that are labeled (e.g. photographs of individuals). AI platforms can help create annotations and labels to prepare your dataset for training. Algorithm and framework selection: Different AI algorithms and frameworks are better suited for different kinds of use cases. An AI platform can help advise you on the best approach to take for your situation. Training: The AI training process can be long and complicated. AI platforms can provide guidance and advice on the best and most efficient way to proceed. AI model generation: Even after training is complete, it can be tricky to take the generated model and start using it for real-world situations. Using an AI platform can help smooth over these bumps. Testing: Before using an AI model in production, it absolutely needs to be tested on a fresh dataset that it hasn’t seen before to assess its true accuracy. Retraining: It’s very rare that an AI model functions perfectly after just a single round of training. Rather, you need to experiment with and fine-tune the results by tweaking the model and the training hyperparameters. Inferencing: Real-time inferencing is crucial for applications such as facial recognition and autonomous vehicles. Deployment to cloud or edge: Finally, AI platforms can help you deploy the finished model to wherever is most convenient for you—whether that’s servers in the cloud or on an edge ai device . Conclusion The Chooch AI platform has a variety of advantages—most importantly, the ability to construct many possible solutions, giving you greater flexibility and agility. That’s why Chooch has built its own AI platform that makes it easy for organizations of all sizes and industries to bring AI into their workflows.

       "  'text': 'Does 5G Make Edge AI Less Critical? | Chooch Far from making edge AI less critical, 5G can actually complement edge AI, with both technologies working in concert to digitally transform your business. It’s understandable why you might think that 5G removes (or at least reduces) the need for edge AI. After all, one of the motivating concerns for edge AI is the latency and slowdown when uploading data to remote cloud servers. Meanwhile, 5G is expected to be significantly faster than 4G. Estimates vary, but analysts predict that 5G could be as much as 10 times faster than 4G in some locations. So if we use 5G to upload AI data, that means we don’t have to worry about upload speeds anymore—right? Well, not quite. For one, 5G won’t always deliver blazing-fast speeds. According to the article linked above, 5G sees the most performance improvements over 4G in densely populated areas. In more remote locations, however, 5G isn’t much better than 4G—barely twice as fast. In addition, latency is only one reason why businesses are choosing edge AI. Some prefer edge AI because it keeps data on the local device, preserving security and privacy. Another motivation for edge AI is decreased costs of data transmission, and the move from 4G to 5G won’t affect the amount of data that needs to be sent to the cloud. So if 5G won’t obviate the need for edge AI, what is the role of 5G in edge computing? Instead of sending data to remote servers, 5G enables you to send data to edge devices more quickly than with 4G. In fact, according to Mark Gilmour, global head of 5G at Colt Technology Services, it’s 5G that will depend on edge computing, not the other way around. More specifically, 5G will have to rely on the edge in order to justify its continued rollout; the two technologies act as “force multipliers” for each other. Gilmour writes: “If we want to step into the full development of the 5G era, then edge computing is imperative and is a critical succeed/fail factor, not just a standalone technology, bandwidth booster or a ‘nice to have.’ Specifically, edge really comes into play when leveraging factors like low latency and high-performance data processing over a cellular connection. You can have edge without 5G, but for these new 5G use cases, you can’t have 5G without edge.” Share Featured Articles Edge AI When is the Right Time to Deploy Edge Computing?

       "  'text': 'The ABCs of Image Annotation or Computer Vision | Chooch What is the fundamental process for developing Computer Vision (CV) systems? The answer: Image Annotation . This blog walks you through the ABCs of image annotation, starting from the fundamentals and progressing to more advanced concepts. Step-by-step you’ll discover how this process, foundational to Chooch, is teaching computers what to see. By the end, you will see how Chooch’s commitment to continuous learning and innovation in AI Vision is reshaping the landscape of computer vision. A is for Annotation: The basics Image annotation is the bedrock of computer vision. It is the meticulous process of identifying, labeling, and classifying various components within an image. This could entail drawing bounding boxes around specific objects, highlighting areas of interest, or even tagging individual pixels. The outcome is a comprehensive visual map from which a machine can learn. In most cases, the annotation task is entrusted to human experts, who bring context, understanding and interpretation to what cameras see. They meticulously label data, creating a rich learning environment for machine learning algorithms . This labeled data is like the textbook for machine learning models, helping them navigate the complex tasks of object detection, image segmentation, and semantic segmentation. While annotation might sound simple, it is a labor-intensive process that requires a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the subject matter. Why is so much effort poured into this task? The answer lies in the quality of the training data. Think of training data as the fuel for your machine learning engine. The cleaner and more refined the fuel, the smoother and more efficiently the engine runs. Similarly, the accuracy and quality of your image annotations directly influence the effectiveness of your trained image models. In other words, the better the annotations, the better your model will interpret new images. Poorly annotated images might lead to a model that misunderstands or misinterprets visual data, which can have significant implications, particularly in critical applications like medical imaging or autonomous vehicles. B is for Bounding Boxes: A core technique In image annotation, bounding boxes are much like the frames we put around our favorite pictures. They provide a way of focusing on specific parts of images. This technique involves drawing a rectangular box around the object we want a machine-learning model to recognize and learn from. Each bounding box comes with a label that denotes what it captures – anything from a “cat” to a “car” or a “person.”\\xa0 Bounding boxes are a staple in object detection tasks, playing a vital role in various applications. Take, for instance, self-driving cars. These autonomous vehicles are equipped with object detection models that have been trained on images annotated with bounding boxes. These boxes serve as guides, helping the model identify key environmental elements like pedestrians, other vehicles, and road signs. This understanding is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of the vehicle. However, like any other tool, bounding boxes have strengths and weaknesses. One of its major strengths is simplicity: they are straightforward to understand and implement. This makes them an ideal choice for many object detection tasks. They are also computationally efficient, a valuable attribute in real-time applications where speed is critical. On the other hand, bounding boxes do have certain limitations. They are less effective when dealing with objects that do not conform to a rectangular shape, as the box may include irrelevant background “noise.” They struggle to differentiate between overlapping objects, as the boxes may encompass more than one object causing ambiguity. C is for Classes and Categories: Organizing annotations Organizing annotations into classes and categories plays a vital role in training machine learning models for image annotation tasks. Each labeled item in image annotation belongs to a specific class or category, which can encompass a diverse range of objects or concepts. From concrete objects like “dogs” and “cars” to abstract ideas like “happy” or “dangerous,” the choice of classes depends on the specific computer vision task. By organizing annotations into classes, we enable the machine learning model to recognize patterns associated with each class. This allows the model to learn and understand the characteristics and features of specific objects distinguishable in one class. As a result, when faced with new, unseen images, the model can accurately predict its appropriate class. Selecting the right classes is crucial for successfully training machine learning models. The granularity and level of detail in defining classes can significantly impact the model’s performance. Fine-grained classes provide a more specific representation, enabling the model to capture intricate patterns and nuances within the data. Coarse-grained classes offer a more generalized object perspective, which can be advantageous when dealing with large-scale datasets or diverse image collections. In addition to classes, organizing annotations into meaningful categories further enhances training. Categories provide a hierarchical structure that groups similar classes, facilitating an understanding of relationships and dependencies between annotations. This hierarchical organization helps create a cohesive framework that aids in training models for complex image annotation tasks. D is for Deep Learning: The power behind computer vision Deep learning , a subset of machine learning , has emerged as a powerful technology that drives most modern computer vision applications. At the heart of deep learning for computer vision lies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specialized neural network designed for image-processing tasks. With their ability to automatically learn and extract features from raw pixel data, CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision. One of the key requirements for deep learning models, including CNNs, is a large amount of annotated data. Annotated data refers to images labeled with precise and accurate annotations, such as bounding boxes, segmentation masks, or keypoint coordinates. These annotations provide ground truth information to the model, allowing it to learn and generalize from the labeled examples. The quality and thoroughness of the annotations play a crucial role in the deep learning model’s performance. When images are meticulously annotated, capturing detailed information about the objects or concepts of interest, the model gains a more comprehensive understanding of the data. This enables the model to learn intricate patterns and make more accurate predictions when presented with new, unseen images. E is for Evaluation: Assessing model performance Once a machine learning model is trained, evaluating its performance is a critical step in understanding its effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement. Evaluation allows us to assess how well the model generalizes new, unseen data and provides insights into its strengths and limitations. One common approach to evaluating model performance in computer vision tasks is using a separate set of annotated images known as the validation set. The validation set is distinct from the training set and serves as an unbiased sample of data that the model has not yet seen during training. By evaluating the model on this independent set of images, we can obtain a realistic estimation of the model’s performance with unseen data. During evaluation, the model’s predictions on the validation set are compared to the actual annotations or ground truth labels. This comparison enables the calculation of various evaluation metrics that quantify various aspects of the model’s performance. Some commonly used metrics in computer vision evaluation include precision, recall, and the F1 score. Evaluation is an iterative process, and it is common to fine-tune models based on the insights gained from the evaluation results. This may involve adjusting model parameters, exploring different training strategies, or collecting additional annotated data to address specific challenges identified during the evaluation. By continuously evaluating and refining the model’s performance, work can progress in developing robust and reliable computer vision systems. Effective evaluation enables informed decisions, optimized model performance, and ultimately AI systems that meet the highest accuracy, reliability, and usability standards. F is for Future: AI-assisted image annotation Looking toward the future, AI-assisted image annotation emerges as a promising development area that can revolutionize the annotation process. By leveraging the power of AI models , we can reduce the workload for human annotators, enhance annotation consistency, and accelerate the overall annotation process. AI-assisted image annotation involves using machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to pre-annotate images automatically. These AI models can be trained on large, annotated datasets, learning to recognize and label objects, regions, or concepts within images. Automating the initial annotation step significantly reduces the burden on human annotators, enabling them to focus on more complex or ambiguous cases that require human expertise. The advantages of AI-assisted annotation go beyond time savings. With the assistance of AI models , annotation consistency can be greatly improved. Human annotators may introduce inconsistencies or subjective biases in their annotations, but AI algorithms can provide a more objective and standardized approach to labeling images. This ensures more annotation consistency, crucial for training accurate and reliable machine learning models. Where will the ABCs take you? Image annotation is a vital process for computer vision, and adhering to the ABCs of image annotation is crucial for accurate and reliable results. At Chooch, we understand the significance of meticulous annotation, whether drawing precise bounding boxes, organizing classes, or evaluating model performance. By adhering to these principles, we ensure annotation quality, consistency, and relevance, enabling the development of robust and effective machine learning models .

       "  'text': 'A Guide to Deep Learning vs Machine Learning | Chooch Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are subsets of artificial intelligence, playing pivotal roles in advanced technology like self-driving cars, voice assistants, and recommendation systems. Machine learning is a data analysis method that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. It uses algorithms to “learn” information directly from data without a predetermined equation as a model. Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning , uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain to carry out machine learning. These networks can transform inputs in increasingly abstract ways, enabling them to solve complex problems previously thought to be the exclusive domain of human cognition. Generally, deep learning is machine learning, but not all machine learning is deep learning. Deep learning can tackle tasks that are too complex for traditional machine learning processes but requires more data and computational horsepower. An introduction to machine learning Machine learning, a foundational part of artificial intelligence (AI), is fundamentally a method of data analysis that empowers computers to uncover hidden insights without explicit programming. Its central principle is rooted in systems learning from data, identifying patterns, and making decisions with minimal human intervention . Three types of machine learning: 1. Supervised Learning In this type of learning, the model is given labeled training data along with the desired output. The goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. It’s akin to learning with a teacher who provides guidance. Common algorithms used in supervised learning include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. According to a survey conducted in 2020, about 89% of data scientists use supervised learning methods in their work. 2. Unsupervised Learning In this scenario, the model is given unlabeled data and must discover the underlying structure and relationships within that data on its own. This is analogous to learning without a teacher. Common algorithms in unsupervised learning include K-means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Principal Component Analysis. While less commonly used than supervised learning, unsupervised learning is vital for anomaly detection and understanding complex datasets. 3. Reinforcement Learning Here, the model learns to make decisions based on rewards and penalties. It’s akin to learning by trial and error taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. Reinforcement learning has been instrumental in teaching computers to perform tasks once thought to require human intuition, such as playing complex games like Go and Chess. AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google DeepMind, used reinforcement learning to defeat the world champion in the board game Go in 2016, marking a significant milestone in AI research. An introduction to deep learning Deep learning, a subset of machine learning , employs artificial neural networks with several layers (“deep” structures) to model and understand complex patterns in datasets. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—to learn from substantial amounts of data. While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help optimize the predictions. The types of deep learning include: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) Inspired by the human brain, ANNs are the foundation of deep learning. They are designed to simulate the behavior of the human brain to solve complex pattern recognition tasks. ANN’s capabilities are highlighted by Google’s DeepMind using them to secure 32 wins out of 40 games against the world champion of the Ancient Game of Go . Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) CNNs are primarily used in pattern recognition within images and are mostly applied in image recognition tasks. They have been instrumental in the medical field, with deep learning techniques achieving 95% accuracy in detecting Parkinson’s disease through voice samples. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) RNNs excel in learning from sequential data, making them especially effective for natural language processing and time-series analysis. Key differences between machine learning and deep learning Data dependencies Machine learning algorithms can perform well in scenarios with massive and large datasets, while deep learning algorithms are better suited for massive datasets. This is because DL models learn complex patterns from the data, and the accuracy of these models generally improves with more data. Computational requirements Deep learning models require significantly more computational power than machine learning models due to their complexity and the large datasets they use. This is especially true for DL models with many layers, often requiring high-performance clusters and other substantial infrastructure. While ML models can run on a single instance or server cluster, DL models typically require powerful hardware accelerators, often GPUs. Feature engineering Data scientists often manually handle data extraction in machine learning, which can be time- and labor-intensive. In contrast, deep learning handles feature extraction automatically during the learning process, which can significantly reduce the workload of data scientists. However, this automatic feature extraction in DL is balanced by the requirement of network topology design, which can put a heavy load on the execution time and efficiency. Interpretability Machine learning models offer precise rules that can be used to explain the decisions behind specific choices, making them easier to interpret. In contrast, the decisions made by deep learning models can seem “arbitrary,” providing the user with little interpretive capability to rationalize choices. This lack of interpretability in DL models is often called the “black box” problem. Training time The training time for DL models is typically longer and more complex due to their intricate neural layers. In contrast, ML algorithms can often be trained in a much shorter time. Problem-solving approach In machine learning , large problems are often broken down into smaller chunks, each solved separately, and then all solutions are put back together. However, deep learning solves problems end-to-end, meaning it takes in raw input (like image pixels or text) and processes it through multiple layers of its neural network to output a result without any need for manual feature extraction or rule-based programming. Hardware dependencies Both machine learning and deep learning require significant computational resources, but the extent and nature of these requirements differ. ML can often run efficiently on modest hardware, while DL generally demands more powerful hardware due to its need for processing large neural networks. For instance, graphics processing units (GPUs) are often employed for DL because they can perform many operations simultaneously – an ideal feature for training large neural networks. Algorithm types ML includes a variety of algorithm types, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, k-means, random forest, and dimensionality reduction algorithms. On the other hand, DL is more focused and includes algorithms such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks, generative adversarial networks, and deep belief networks. Applications of machine learning and deep learning Machine learning in action Traditional ML algorithms, like decision trees, are rule-based and are excellent for problems where the reasoning process is well-understood and can be defined in terms of rules or conditions. Machine learning techniques are effective with smaller datasets, especially if the dataset is well-curated, like structured data, where features have clear definitions and relationships. Machine learning has wide-ranging applications in various fields: Predicting house prices With Linear Regression, we can estimate the price of a house based on simple features such as the number of bedrooms, location, and size of the house. This is commonly used in the real estate industry. Diagnosing patient illnesses Decision Trees and Random Forests can help doctors diagnose diseases by looking at past patient records. This tool can learn from these past cases to make accurate predictions. Recognizing faces Support Vector Machines (SVMs) help in recognizing faces in images. This can be used in various systems, such as security, to identify or verify a person from a digital image or a video frame. Suggesting products or movies K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is used in services like Amazon or Netflix to suggest items you might like. This is done based on your past behavior and the behavior of other users like you. Filtering spam and understanding customer opinions Naive Bayes is used to sort your emails, identifying which ones are likely to be spam. It’s also used to understand whether customer reviews are positive, negative, or neutral. Deep learning in action Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is particularly adept at managing problems where the reasoning process is intricate and not readily expressible in explicit rules. Unstructured data, such as images, audio, and text, often contain relationships and complex patterns that are challenging to capture using traditional, rule-based methods. It’s in these domains where deep learning truly shines. Deep learning relies heavily on artificial neural networks, particularly those with numerous layers, hence the term “deep.” These multilayered networks mimic the human brain’s function, allowing the model to learn intricate patterns and perform abstract reasoning. Because of this, deep learning can outperform traditional machine learning in tasks involving high-dimensional, unstructured data. Let’s consider some common applications of deep learning to illustrate its capabilities: Computer vision Deep learning algorithms are proficient at identifying, classifying, and labeling objects in images and videos. They form the backbone of numerous applications, including facial recognition software, object detection in surveillance systems, and even disease diagnosis in medical imaging. Language translation Deep learning has revolutionized the field of natural language processing, including language translation. For example, Google’s neural machine translation system uses deep learning to translate between languages with remarkable accuracy, often matching or surpassing human translators. Sentiment analysis Deep learning is extensively used in sentiment analysis, which involves understanding human emotions from text. This application is particularly beneficial in marketing and customer service, where understanding customer sentiment can inform strategy and improve service delivery. Autonomous driving Autonomous vehicles utilize deep learning to perceive their environment and make driving decisions. They use it to recognize objects, predict their movements, and determine optimal paths. Virtual assistants Deep learning is crucial in virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant, and Apple’s Siri. These systems use it to understand spoken language, recognize the user’s voice, and generate natural-sounding responses. Playing favorites—Deep learning vs. machine learning Machine learning and deep learning are two significant subsets of artificial intelligence with unique strengths. Machine learning excels in structured data environments with clear rules, making it ideal for applications ranging from real estate to healthcare. On the other hand, deep learning is particularly adept with unstructured data like images, audio, and text, making strides in computer vision, language processing, and autonomous driving. Choosing between them is not superiority but problem applicability, data nature, and resource availability. Both continue to drive advancements across numerous fields, revolutionizing the era of artificial intelligence applications.

       "  'text': '5 Common Problems With Computer Vision And Solutions | Chooch Computer vision (CV) is reshaping industries with diverse applications, from self-driving cars to augmented reality, facial recognition systems, and medical diagnostics. “No industry has been or will be untouched by computer vision innovation, and the next generation of emerging technologies will generate new market opportunities and innovations, including: Scene understanding and fine-grained object and behavior recognition for security, worker health and safety, and critical patient care.” Despite the robust growth and increasing market value, computer vision still faces challenges\\u200b. Innovations like the shift from model-centric to data-centric artificial intelligence and the rise of Generative AI appear promising for tackling common computer vision challenges. As we delve into five common problems, we’ll explore the solutions, and how they pave the way for a more advanced and efficient use of computer vision. 1. Variable lighting conditions Problem: One of the significant challenges for computer vision systems is dealing with varied lighting conditions . Changes in lighting can considerably alter the appearance of an object in an image, making it difficult for the system to recognize. The lighting challenges in computer vision is complex due to the difference between human visual perception and camera image processing. While humans can easily adjust to different lighting conditions, computer vision systems can struggle with it. Varying amounts of light in other parts of the combined with shadows and highlights distort the appearance of objects. Moreover, different types of light (e.g., natural, artificial, direct, diffused) can create other visual effects, further complicating the object recognition task for these systems. Solution: Techniques such as histogram equalization and gamma correction help counteract the effects of variable lighting conditions. Histogram equalization is a method that improves the contrast of an image by redistributing the most frequent intensity values across the image. At the same time, gamma correction adjusts the brightness of an image by applying a nonlinear operation to the pixel values. These methods adjust the brightness across an image, improving the system’s ability to identify objects irrespective of lighting conditions. Another approach to the problem of variable lighting conditions involves using hardware solutions, such as infrared sensors or depth cameras. These devices can capture information that isn’t affected by lighting conditions, making object recognition more manageable. For instance, depth cameras can provide data about the distance of different parts of an object from the camera, which help identify the object even when lighting conditions make it difficult to discern its shape or color in a traditional 2D image. Similarly, infrared sensors can detect heat signatures, providing additional clues about an object’s identity. 2. Perspective and scale variability Problem: Objects can appear differently depending on their distance, angle, or size in relation to the camera. This variability in perspective and scale presents a significant challenge for computer vision systems . In remote sensing applications, accurate object detection from aerial images is more difficult due to the variety of objects that can be present, in addition to significant variations in scale and orientation\\u200b. Solution: Techniques such as Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) , Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF), and similar methods can identify and compare objects in images regardless of scale or orientation. SIFT is a method that can more reliably identify objects even among clutter and under partial occlusion, as it is an invariant to uniform scaling, orientation, and illumination changes. It also offers partial invariance to affine distortion. The SIFT descriptor is based on image measurements over local scale-invariant reference frames established by local scale selection. The SIFT features are local and based on the object’s appearance at particular interest points, making them invariant to image scale and rotation. 3. Occlusion Problem: Occlusion refers to scenarios where another object hides or blocks part of an object . This challenge varies depending on the context and sensor setup used in computer vision . For instance, in object tracking, occlusion occurs when an object being tracked is hidden by another object, like two people walking past each other or a car driving under a bridge. In range cameras, occlusion represents areas where no information is present because the camera and laser are not aligned, or in stereo imaging, parts of the scene that are only visible to one of the two cameras. This issue poses a significant challenge to computer vision systems as they may struggle to identify and track partially obscured objects correctly over time. Solution: “Techniques like Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) can help separate an image’s background and foreground, potentially making occluded objects more distinguishable. RPCA is a modification of the principal component analysis (PCA) statistical procedure, which aims to recover a low-rank matrix from highly corrupted observations. In video surveillance, if we stack the video frames as matrix columns, the low-rank component naturally corresponds to the stationary background, and the sparse component captures the moving objects in the foreground\\u200b. Training models on datasets that include occluded objects can improve their ability to handle such scenarios. However, creating these datasets poses a challenge due to the requirement of a large number and variety of occluded video objects with modal mask annotations. A possible solution is to use a self-supervised approach to create realistic data in large quantities. For instance, the YouTube-VOI dataset contains 5,305 videos, a 65-category label set including common objects such as people, animals, and vehicles, with over 2 million occluded and visible masks for moving video objects. A unified multi-task framework, such as the Video Object Inpainting Network (VOIN), can infer invisible occluded object regions and recover object appearances . The evaluation of the VOIN model on the YouTube-VOI benchmark demonstrates its advantages in handling occlusions\\u200b\\u200b. 4. Contextual understanding Problem: Computer vision systems often need help with understanding context. They can identify individual objects in an image, but understanding the relationship between them and interpreting the scene can be problematic. Solution: Scene understanding techniques are being developed to tackle this problem. One particularly challenging field within scene understanding is Concealed Scene Understanding (CSU), which involves recognizing objects with camouflaged properties in natural or artificial scenarios. The CSU field has advanced in recent years with deep learning techniques and the creation of large-scale public datasets such as COD10K , which has advanced the development of visual perception tasks, especially in concealed scenarios. A benchmark for Concealed Object Segmentation (COS), a crucial area within CSU, has been created for quantitative evaluation of the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, the applicability of deep CSU in real-world scenarios has been assessed by restructuring the CDS2K dataset to include challenging cases from various industrial settings\\u200b. Furthermore, incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can help models understand relations between objects in an image . GNNs have become a standard component of many 2D image understanding pipelines, as they can provide a natural way to represent the relational arrangement between objects in an image. They have been especially used in tasks such as image captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA), and image retrieval. These tasks require the model to reason about the image to describe it, explain aspects of it, or find similar images, which are all tasks that humans can do with relative ease but are difficult for deep learning models. 5. Lack of annotated data Problem: Training computer vision models necessitates a substantial amount of annotated data. Image annotation, a critical component of training AI-based computer vision models, involves human annotators structuring data. For example, images are annotated to create training data for computer vision models identifying specific objects across a dataset \\u200b. However, manual annotation is a labor-intensive process that often necessitates domain expertise, and this process can consume a significant amount of time, particularly when dealing with large datasets\\u200b. Solution: Semi-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques offer promising solutions to this issue. These methods leverage unlabeled data, making the learning process more efficient . Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to jointly learn from sparsely labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled auxiliary data. The underlying assumption is that the unlabeled data is often drawn from the same distribution as the labeled data. SSL has been used in various application domains such as image search, medical data analysis, web page classification, document retrieval, genetics, and genomics. Unsupervised learning (UL) aims to learn from only unlabeled data without utilizing any task-relevant label supervision. Once trained, the model can be fine-tuned using labeled data to achieve better model generalization in a downstream task\\u200b. Also, techniques like data augmentation can artificially increase the size of the dataset by creating altered versions of existing images. Computer vision’s next frontier and AI’s role as its primary catalyst Computer vision is an immensely beneficial technology with widespread applications, spanning industries from retail to manufacturing , and beyond. However, it has its challenges. Factors such as varied lighting conditions, perspective and scale variability, occlusion, lack of contextual understanding, and the need for more annotated data have created obstacles in the journey toward fully efficient and reliable computer vision systems . Researchers and engineers continually push the field’s boundaries in addressing these issues. Techniques such as histogram equalization, gamma correction, SIFT, SURF, RPCA, and the use of CNNs, GNNs, and semi-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, along with data augmentation strategies, have all been instrumental in overcoming these challenges. Continued investment in research, development, and training of the next generation of computer vision scientists is vital for the field’s evolution. As computer vision advances, it will play an increasingly important role in driving efficiency and innovation in many sectors of the economy and society. Despite the challenges faced, the future of computer vision technology remains promising, with immense potential to reshape our world. Computer vision platforms of tomorrow The most recent wave of generative AI technologies will prove instrumental in shaping the next iterations of computer vision solutions. Today’s computer vision platforms use AI to detect events, objects, and actions that neural networks have been trained to identify, but tomorrow’s platforms may use AI to speculate the outcome of events, objects’ state or positions, and the results of actions before they occur. The true challenge of today’s AI-powered vision-based systems is their narrow understanding. For a model to “know” how to spot more objects, it must be familiar with those things. More knowledge means more training and heavier models. Our society is on the precipice of general AI, which will provide always-on, hyper-intelligent, digital assistants to tomorrow’s enterprises. Such assistants will not just know how to detect things it knows, but they will know how to learn and how to communicate what they see. Replicating human visual understanding has never been closer to a reality as it is today.

       "  'text': '6 Ways Computer Vision is Driving Predictive Maintenance As we enter the age of advanced technology known as Industry 4.0, smart devices, computer vision AI, and data analysis enable manufacturers to build a comprehensive strategy that combines various data-driven approaches to optimize manufacturing processes known as predictive manufacturing. Manufacturers are applying data and predictive modeling to anticipate and prevent equipment failures or breakdowns, known as predictive maintenance. Predictive maintenance is helping manufacturers to improve the efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of their operations. Benefits of predictive maintenance beyond predicting maintenance The adoption of predictive maintenance has grown in recent years due to advancements in technology, the availability of data, and the benefits both offer. However, predictive maintenance isn’t just about preventing machine breakdowns, it has several other benefits that positively affect various aspects of manufacturing. Here are a few reasons why manufacturing companies are embracing predictive maintenance: Reduces costs: Identifying potential equipment issues before they disrupt operations saves time and money. Early detection, coupled with the ability to forecast maintenance needs, reduces emergency repairs and extends machine life. Increases safety: Proactively addressing equipment issues reduces the risk of employee accidents or injuries due to equipment failure and improves the overall safety of their work environment. This EHS commitment provides employees with a greater sense of security. Reduces workloads: By minimizing unexpected equipment breakdowns and failures, employees are less likely to be called upon for emergency repairs or troubleshooting tasks. This reduces the burden on their workload and improves productivity and job satisfaction. Improves planning and scheduling: Based on data-driven insights, maintenance activities can be planned and scheduled. A clear plan and schedule for maintenance tasks enables employees to better allocate their time and resources and reduces the likelihood of last-minute disruptions or overtime work. Competitive advantage: By reducing operational costs, improving product quality, and enhancing customer satisfaction, companies can gain a competitive edge. By minimizing equipment downtime and maximizing production efficiency, they can deliver products more reliably and meet customer demands effectively. It’s clear that by optimizing maintenance, manufacturers not only improve operations and reduce costs but also create a more efficient and productive environment for their employees leading to an improved overall sense of well-being and superior job performance. The role of computer vision in predictive maintenance So where does computer vision fit in. Manufacturing is a world of precision and consistency; the tiniest defect can make a big impact. Traditional equipment inspection methods, either by human scrutiny or machine systems, have limitations, such as fatigue, lack of adaptability, and inability to spot certain defects. Computer vision is beginning to play a crucial role in helping to augment traditional inspection processes. It can collect massive amounts of data from equipment, machinery, or production environments which can be analyzed faster and with greater accuracy, saving time and effort compared to traditional methods. By analyzing real-time sensor data and historical performance data, computer vision can easily identify patterns, detect anomalies, and provide early warnings of potential equipment issues. This allows maintenance teams to schedule maintenance activities proactively, minimizing downtime, reducing costs, and optimizing the lifespan of equipment. So, let’s explore the 6 ways computer vision is helping in predictive maintenance: 1. Anomaly detection: Computer vision algorithms can analyze images or videos captured by cameras to detect anomalies or deviations from normal operating conditions. By comparing real-time visual data to baseline or reference images, computer vision systems can quickly identify signs of potential equipment failure, such as abnormal vibrations, leaks, cracks, or irregularities in the appearance of components. These anomalies can often be very subtle and easily missed by the human eye, making computer vision far more accurate and reliable for detecting defects faster. 2. Wear and tear assessment: Computer vision can monitor the wear and tear of equipment components over time. Advanced image segmentation techniques, like semantic segmentation, identify the exact location and size of the potential equipment degradation. By collecting this data at these levels of specificity, it makes it easier to track over time the condition of machine parts and signs of degradation or corrosion to estimate their remaining useful life. This information helps maintenance teams plan timely replacements or repairs, minimizing downtime, and optimizing maintenance schedules. 3. Real-time monitoring: Computer vision enables real-time monitoring of production processes and equipment performance. By analyzing visual data, computer vision systems detect deviations from normal operating parameters, such as temperature, pressure, or speed. When abnormal conditions are detected, pre-programmed actions can be initiated, and real-time notifications can alert maintenance teams to intervene promptly to prevent potential failures that could disrupt operations. 4. Object recognition and tracking: Computer vision can recognize and track objects, such as tools, parts, or products, within a manufacturing environment. Computer vision models using algorithms like Single Shot MultiBox Detectors (SSD), can detect and classify multiple objects within video images in real time. This helps in monitoring the movement and usage of equipment and assets within the manufacturing environment. For example, camera video streams can be analyzed in real time to track the location of tools and equipment to prevent loss or identify instances of improper handling. 5. Inspection automation: By combining computer vision, robotics, and data analysis, equipment inspection processes and condition reports can be automated. For example, video data captured by cameras can be analyzed using deep learning algorithms to learn hierarchical representations of this data to deliver more accurate object recognition, image classification, and location segmentation. This level of analysis can detect defects, measure dimensions, or identify irregularities in components faster and more accurately; reducing the reliance on human inspectors and speeding up maintenance procedures. 6. Predictive analytics: Computer vision data, when combined with other sensor data, can be leveraged for predictive analytics. By analyzing historical visual data and equipment performance, computer vision systems can identify patterns, correlations, or early warning signs of potential failures. This enables maintenance teams to predict maintenance actions before they are needed and plan proactive interventions. The future of predictive maintenance with computer vision Computer vision provides manufacturers the ability to continuously monitor the health of equipment without fatigue. Just like a human, when a computer vision system detects a potential failure pattern, it can alert the maintenance team, allowing for timely replacement and avoid unexpected downtime. In a nutshell, computer vision is making machine maintenance smarter, safer, and more efficient. Not without implementation challenges, including data privacy concerns, the need for high-quality data for training AI models, and the technological infrastructure required, predictive maintenance driven by computer vision technology will become the norm in manufacturing. And as it continues to advance and merge with other technologies like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, it’s set to revolutionize machine maintenance even further.

       "  'text': '4 Ways Generative AI Is Improving Computer Vision | Chooch Unless you’ve been living in a cave for the last year, you’ve probably heard of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Bard. Chances are, you’ve tested some out. Generative AI is already fusing with our daily processes, after all; Microsoft is embedding ChatGPT into its applications , just as Google is integrating Bard into G-suite tools . So far, generative AI tools have gotten the most attention for the ways they help people in everyday life, such as using text-based outputs to write software code, college application essays, or a clinical treatment plan. Some use visual output to design websites or produce 3D models for video games, while a new Beatles song using an old clip of John Lennon’s voice uses audio-based output. But generative AI is also improving existing technology – including computer vision. From generating fresh content to creating synthetic data , generative AI is bringing a new sophistication to computer vision technology. Today we’re looking at four improvements to computer vision that generative AI is making, and how Chooch’s AI Vision Platform and new ImageChat model is unleashing these benefits. From insight to innovation If you’re not familiar with how generative AI works, it draws on several techniques. Most of us are familiar with large language models (LLM), a branch of machine learning. These models are trained on massive data sets, including text, images, and sounds. Using prediction algorithms, they respond to human prompts; our feedback and reinforcement learning helps them refine their output. But generative AI does much more than answer questions. Here are four ways it works with computer vision to bring deeper insights and greater innovation to organizations. #1. Improved quality and accuracy One of the primary computer vision use cases is to recognize and classify objects – from weapon detection to facial recognition to PPE checks . Generative AI enhances this ability by removing noise and artifacts from imagery and video, increasing image resolution, and canceling background noise. The result: sharper imagery, faster object identification, and fewer false positives. This can be critical for a security team using computer vision to detect weapons at a school or a factory monitoring PPE compliance to prevent shop floor accidents. It can also help clinicians use highly detailed medical imaging scans in ultrasound, x-ray, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose conditions, understand where to place a biopsy needle, or form a treatment plan. #2. The creation of realistic images Because generative AI can create extremely realistic new images and videos, it can assist computer vision by generating original 3D models of objects, machine components, buildings, medications, people, landscapes, and more. Users don’t have to search for an actual image or footage that already exists; they can simply develop their own and extract more useful insights. For an engineering company, this could take the form of designing innovative new products via simulation; federal organizations could develop smarter prevention and mitigation strategies for wildfires and other natural disasters by analyzing realistic footage and photos of simulated events to understand how they would unfold. #3. Synthetic data Data is the lifeblood of computer vision, but data annotation has been a barrier to AI adoption. Generative AI overcomes this barrier by creating synthetic, automatically labelled, new data elements that help train computer vision models how to see, learn, and predict. Although organizations have been reluctant to share sensitive data with third parties because of the security risk, privacy is no longer a concern as synthetic data can’t be linked to a real person. This also addresses the ethics issue of bias in models; while teams have worried about bias filtering into models through the data they’re trained on, synthetic data can eliminate any possibility of bias. #4. More comprehensive data resources Computer vision models are trained on vast quantities of data – but some generative AI models tap into even bigger data stores, including data that’s never been leveraged before. Combining computer vision AI and large language models for image-to-text provides the ability to gain more detailed insights into visuals. Analysts can craft targeted prompts to obtain specific information based on what’s most important to their business. For example, they can ask questions like “what objects are present in this image?” or “where is the person located in the video?”\\xa0 By fine-tuning text prompts, they can narrow down their text queries to extract precise information which they may not have been able to do before. More actionable, higher quality data enhances the accuracy of computer vision tools and accelerates the benefits that they bring to organizations.

       "  'text': 'What Is Object Detection | Chooch Object detection, also known as object recognition, is a computer vision technique to identify and classify specific objects or patterns within an image or video. Object detection detects the presence of objects, recognizes what they are, and identifies their location in the image. Often times, object detection and image recognition/classification are used synonymously. But while they are similar, they are very distinct computer vision tasks. What is an object detection model? An object detection model, also known as an object recognition algorithm, is a computational model designed to recognize and classify objects within images or videos. These models are trained on large datasets with labeled examples, where each example is associated with a specific object class or category. Object detection models use a variety of techniques from computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning to learn the patterns and features that distinguish each specific object class or category. For example, given a photograph of a city street, an object detection model would return a list of annotations or labels for all the different objects in the image: traffic lights, vehicles, road signs, buildings, etc. These labels would contain both the appropriate category for each object, such as “person” and a “bounding box,” or rectangle in which the object is completely contained. Another example is given a photograph of a dog, an object recognition model returns a label and bounding box for the dog, as well as other prominent objects. The difference between object detection and image recognition models As mentioned earlier, while both object detection and image recognition are similar, an image recognition model categorizes the entire image with a single label. An object detection model identifies and classifies individual objects or patterns within an image or video. For example, an image recognition model would simply return “cottage.” Using the same example, an object detection model would return other prominent objects in the image, for example thatch, house, cottage. 6 Common object recognition techniques Let’s explore the most common object recognition techniques used in computer vision. Often, they work together to provide a comprehensive understanding of objects within visual data. Once trained, the computer vision model can accurately recognize and classify objects based on their visual appearance and characteristics. Depending upon the application, different combinations or variations of techniques are used based on training requirements. Object detection: This technique locates and identifies multiple instances of objects within an image or video by drawing a bounding box around the objects of interest and providing a label or class for each bounding box. Object segmentation: Object segmentation separates individual objects within an image or video by assigning a pixel-level mask to each object. Each pixel is assigned a value or color code based on the object or class it corresponds to. This segmentation provides a more detailed understanding of the object’s boundaries and more precise object recognition. Object tracking: Object tracking involves following the movement of a specific object across frames in a video sequence. The goal of object tracking is to maintain a consistent association between the object being tracked and its representation in subsequent frames, even as the object changes, such as appearance, scale, orientation, and occlusion. It is useful in applications like video surveillance and autonomous vehicles. Object recognition and classification: This technique not only detects objects and understands their spatial location but also identifies and categorizes objects into predefined classes or categories. It involves training models to recognize specific objects based on their visual features and assigning them classes, such as cars, people, animals, or specific objects like chairs or cups. Pose estimation: Pose estimation infers the body joint positions and skeletal structure from images or videos. It estimates the pose of a person, including the positions and orientations of body parts, such as the head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. Because it understands the pose or pose changes, it is useful in augmented reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction applications. Instance segmentation: This combines object detection and semantic segmentation techniques. It detects the presence and location of an object and then segments each object separately by providing both bounding box coordinates and pixel-level masks for each individual object instance in an image or video. Industry applications use cases for object detection Object detection is a key task for humans: when entering a new room or scene, our first instinct is to visually assess the objects and people it contains and then make sense of them. Similar to humans, object detection plays a crucial role in enabling computers to understand and interact with the visual world. Object recognition is used in many use cases across industries including: Workplace safety and security AI: Object detection models can help improve workplace safety and security. For example, they can detect the presence of suspicious individuals or vehicles in a sensitive area. More creatively, it can help ensure that workers are using personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, helmets, or masks. Media: Object detection models can help recognize the presence of certain brands, products, logos, or people in digital media. Advertisers can then use this information to collect metadata and show more relevant ads to users. It also helps automate the process of detecting and flagging inappropriate or prohibited content, such as explicit images, violence, hate speech, or other forms of harmful or offensive material. Social media sites rely on this type of content moderation to protect their community members and the integrity of their site. Manufacturing quality control: Object detection models enable automation of visual data review. Computers and cameras can analyze data real-time and automatically detect and process visual information and understand its significance which reduces the need for manual intervention in tasks where constant visual reviews are required. This is particularly beneficial for manufacturing production quality control . It not only enhances efficiency but also detects production anomalies that may go unnoticed by the human eye which prevent potential production disruption or product recalls. The importance of object detection in computer vision Object detection techniques are crucial in computer vision. These algorithms enable machines to understand, interpret, and make decisions based on visual data.

       "  'text': 'What is Computer Vision | Chooch Computer Vision: Definition and working principle Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand and interpret visual information, just like humans do. By using complex algorithms and techniques, computer vision allows machines to analyze and interpret images or videos — recognizing objects, detecting and tracking movements, and even estimating depth and dimensions. Computer vision has become an essential technology in various applications such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, medical imaging, and even social media filters. What is computer vision? The origins of computer vision can be traced back to the 1950s when researchers first started exploring ways to mimic human vision using computational techniques. As technology advanced, so did the capabilities of computer vision systems. The introduction of more powerful hardware, such as GPUs, allowed for faster and more efficient processing of visual data. This, coupled with the development of sophisticated algorithms and machine learning techniques, enabled computer vision systems to tackle more complex tasks. One of the most significant advancements in recent years has been deep learning. Deep learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that focuses on using artificial neural networks to automatically learn from vast amounts of data and uncover intricate patterns within it. It is critical in computer vision techniques involving pattern recognition, classification, regression, and other complex data analysis tasks. Let’s take a closer look at how computer vision works and these techniques. How computer vision works? Computer vision systems rely on a combination of hardware and algorithms to process visual data. By combining these steps, computer vision algorithms can detect objects, extract relevant features, and make sense of the visual information. Image acquisition: The process begins with capturing an image or video using cameras or other imaging devices. The quality and resolution of the images acquired influence the accuracy of subsequent computer vision tasks. Preprocessing: Once the data is captured, it undergoes preprocessing to clean up the images and adjusts them to make them easier to work with. This might involve removing noise, adjusting colors, and resizing images. Feature extraction: Lastly, the computer vision system identifies and extracts important parts of the images, for example color, texture, shape, edges, corners, or any other characteristic that helps the computer understand what is in the images. Let’s break down a few common scenarios that happen after feature extraction. The next steps typically involve using those extracted features to perform specific tasks, such as object recognition , classification, segmentation, or any other analysis you might be interested in. Types of computer vision techniques Action recognition : Identifies when a person is performing a given action (e.g., running, sleeping, falling, etc.). Image classification : Categorizes images into predefined classes or categories. The goal is to train a model to recognize and assign a label to an input image based on the features and patterns present in the image. Image recognition : Identifies the most important high-level contents of an image. For example, given an image of a soccer game, a computer vision model trained for image recognition might return simply “soccer game.” Image segmentation: Isolates the areas of interest, for example it can separate the foreground (objects of interest) from the background and assigns a category to each pixel in the image, grouping them together into objects, people, backgrounds, etc. Object tracking : Estimates the motion of objects between consecutive frames. Machine learning and neural networks : Extracted features often serve as input for machine learning models or deep neural networks. These models learn from the features to make predictions or decisions based on the data they’ve been trained on. Business impact of computer vision and challenges Computer vision technology is driving innovation across many industries and use cases and is creating unprecedented business applications and opportunities. It’s being used across all industries to address a broad and growing range of business applications. These include physical security, retail , automotive, robotics, healthcare , manufacturing , supply chain/logistics, government, media and entertainment, and Internet of Things (IoT). 2 major computer vision concerns As tools and services continue to drive down costs and improve performance and confidence in computer vision systems, there continues to be concerns around ethics and the lack of explainability of sophisticated approaches. Concerns surrounding privacy and data security continue to be paramount. Privacy The ability to capture, analyze, and store substantial amounts of visual data raises questions about who has access to this information and how it is used. Striking the right balance between the benefits of computer vision and protecting individual privacy is a critical consideration in moving forward. Bias Computer vision algorithms learn from data, and if the training data is biased, it can lead to biased outcomes. For example, facial recognition algorithms trained on predominantly male faces may struggle to correctly identify female faces. Addressing bias in computer vision algorithms is essential to avoid perpetuating existing societal biases and ensuring fair and ethical use of computer vision technology. What does the future hold for computer vision With the continuous advancements in technology and the increasing availability of large datasets, the future of computer vision looks promising. As computer vision systems become more sophisticated and capable, they have the potential to revolutionize various industries and reshape the way we interact with machines. Gartner predicts based on current trends and projections; computer vision will grow as a popular application for edge deployments – Edge Computer Vision . “By 2025, Gartner expects computer vision implementations leveraging edge architectures to increase to 60%, up from 20% in 2022.” Emerging Technologies: Computer Vision Is Advancing to Be Smarter, More Actionable and on the Edge, Gartner July 2022 How can Chooch help computer vision?

Techniques such as histogram equalization, gamma correction, SIFT, SURF, RPCA, and the use of CNNs, GNNs, and semi-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, along with data augmentation strategies, have all been instrumental in overcoming these challenges. Continued investment in research, development, and training of the next generation of computer vision scientists is vital for the field’s evolution. As computer vision advances, it will play an increasingly important role in driving efficiency and innovation in many sectors of the economy and society. Despite the challenges faced, the future of computer vision technology remains promising, with immense potential to reshape our world. Computer vision platforms of tomorrow The most recent wave of generative AI technologies will prove instrumental in shaping the next iterations of computer vision solutions. Today’s computer vision platforms use AI to detect events, objects, and actions that neural networks have been trained to identify, but tomorrow’s platforms may use AI to speculate the outcome of events, objects’ state or positions, and the results of actions before they occur. The true challenge of today’s AI-powered vision-based systems is their narrow understanding. For a model to “know” how to spot more objects, it must be familiar with those things. More knowledge means more training and heavier models. Our society is on the precipice of general AI, which will provide always-on, hyper-intelligent, digital assistants to tomorrow’s enterprises. Such assistants will not just know how to detect things it knows, but they will know how to learn and how to communicate what they see. Replicating human visual understanding has never been closer to a reality as it is today.

no problem! jurassic-1 custom models offer excellent accuracy even when trained on a surprisingly small dataset. nevertheless, sometimes even a small annotated dataset is hard to come by. wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it be nice to enjoy the benefits of custom models without collecting any labeled data? as we will now demonstrate in our topic classification case study, this is possible. first, we note two simple observations: a prompt engineering solution with 1-4 examples per class achieves reasonable accuracy. the model assigns a probability to the label it generates, which indicates its â\\x80\\x9cconfidenceâ\\x80\\x9d in the label. high-confidence labels are more likely to be correct predictions. relying on these two observations, we propose the following simple approach: collect many unlabeled input examples for topic classification. use a', 'timestamp': '2023-10-06T18:11:24Z', 'websiteAddress': 'ai21.com'}, {'key': 'https://www.chooch.com/blog/synthetic-data-webinar-faster-ai-model-generation-more-accurate-computer-vision/_chunk_10', 'pageURL': 'https://www.chooch.com/blog/synthetic-data-webinar-faster-ai-model-generation-more-accurate-computer-vision/', 'text': 'any of the servers. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. And the next question is a comment. We need a webinar on model creation. Well, I’m sure we’ll publish one on that very soon. Is there an advantage to using a tight bounding polygon over a simple bounding box, advantages of background removal? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, that’s a very good question. So depending on your use case, bounding box or polygon, you’re going to choose between the two basically. And data scientists know which ones work for what. For 90% of use cases that we do, bounding box is fine. But even the bounding box itself, it actually segments that piece out. And that’s how the 2D generation is generated. So background removal is crucial. You cannot do background removal without polygon segmentation. And that’s how the 2D synthetic works. But in terms of inferencing and creating data set, bounding boxes are usually enough for generic deployments. We have sensitive deployment like satellite imagery or radiology, you definitely need polygon. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yep. We already answered to some degree, perhaps you’re getting to dive into this a little bit. Do you support edge inferencing? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, we support edge inferencing. The inference engine is exportable into the GPU devices and also Intel devices. And it’s basically a Docker that you pull and it gets set up within half an hour. And you can put models onto it, you can do updates, you can erase models, you can visualize the inferencing on it. So yes, edge inferencing is a crucial part of this whole system because if you don’t have edge inferencing, it’s virtually impossible to scale video in the long run. Jeffrey Goldsmith: And we’ve actually got documentation on how to deploy to the edge on our website, under the products section at the bottom. There’s a few different help documents. Next, synthetic data looks different. How can we know it will perform well? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so it looks different and you’re going to have to iterate on it. And that’s what we do as well. And the way to iterate is you create a model, basically. And you create the model on the system and see how it performs, test it on the system that you’ve created the synthetic data on, it’s basically all together. So you’re right, you need to iterate on these. It’s not going to perform well the first time. It’ll perform … Depends on the use case, obviously but usually it takes us about four to five iterations to get to a model that is production ready. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Pretty technical question here. Do you use GANs or VAEs to create synthetic data? Emrah Gultekin: This is a good question. And we are not using GANs or VAEs to create yet, but we’re using randomization. I think some our ML engineers can answer this much better. But basically, we’re in the process of putting GANs into the system, though, as we speak.

You can generate more on that and there are different types of best practices for that. But you want to get to about 1000 images. How you get to there, that’s up to you. You can use synthetic, you can use … If you have real, that’s always better. But a minimum of 1000 and then just keep going up from 1000 for production purposes. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay. Do you support deployment on mobile? We actually have a mobile app. But I really want to … Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so the deployment on a mobile is through an API. So we’ll be hitting the cloud. If you’re talking about the models being deployed on mobile, we don’t do that at the moment. But we do deploy on Nvidia Jetson devices, also Intel CPUs as well. But in terms of the mobile apps, it’s traditionally been just API call on the cloud. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah, we actually have a mobile app if you search in any app store for Chooch IC2. You can install it on your phone and try it. It basically sends screen grabs from your video feed to the cloud and it sends back metadata. It’s pretty cool, actually. So next question, how important is it to train the data with different backgrounds? Can we load our own backgrounds with different conditions and lightings to train? There we go. Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, it’s a good question. So we have some preset backgrounds that you can use. But usually what happens is the client has their own warehouse or manufacturing area, then they can load up that background as well. And so you can use that background to synthesize your data as well. So that’s under my themes. And basically, you just … You can upload to a data set itself or you can upload to raw data, and just pull that in when you click onto my themes. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, great question. What if my data is sensitive and cannot go out of my company? Is it possible to deploy it on company servers? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so this is a great question. And what we’re doing is we have … The inference engine is Dockerized. And you can deploy the inference engine on prem, which means none of that video inferencing or image inferencing will leave your device or your on prem installation. For the entire system, we’re working on Dockerizing that, including the training system and the data generation system, and we have clients who are waiting for that actually. It’s quite important.

That variation can be on the amount of data being supplied and the complexity in which we’re tackling. Now, traditionally, a typical model can take between six months to a year to develop, but with the tools that we show today, you can rapidly develop models and being very conservative in a matter of a couple of weeks.

But we’re seeing it more in geospatial. Jeffrey Goldsmith: We keep getting questions, which is fine, we still have some time here. How can you generate, for example, a partially covered stop sign with automated labeling? I mean … Emrah Gultekin: It’s a good question. And so this goes into CGI really and it is a universe unto itself. So you need a CGI person to create that base data to generate that. [crosstalk 00:54:46]. So you generate one of them and then basically the system randomize the rest. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Exactly. Is it possible to train them on like … We answered this to some degree but is it possible to train the model and export it in order run it without Chooch? Emrah Gultekin: This is a good question because what happens is these models that you see on the Chooch system are not really single models. They’re always ensembles, and they’re encoded with information from the past, from the purpose that it has already generated over the years. So it’s not possible to do it without the Chooch system on prem or on a device, but you’re able to export the system as well. So you can export the system to wherever you want to, but you can’t take these models out of a vacuum and have them perform. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Let’s see here, could you say which one works better, training the model with synthetic data entirely and later fine tuning the model with real data or training the model with a hybrid data, synthetic data and real data? Depends on the use case. Emrah Gultekin: So it’s always better to have real data, that is key. It’s always important to have that. The more real data you have, the better your model’s going to perform in the long run. But if you don’t have real data, you need to synthesize it. And that’s where the synthetic data comes into play. So if you do have real data, it’s important to have that with the data set that you’re basically trying to train. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. Last question … Oh, there’s even one more in the Q&A. They keep coming. So I want to share the preset with coworkers. Where can I find the video link? I’ll post it on our blog tomorrow, sometime in the afternoon but it’ll also be automatically sent to everyone who signed up for the Zoom webinar and on LinkedIn as well. Let’s see. Does Chooch work with all the major public cloud vendors, AWS, Azure, IBM, etc? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, so currently we’re on AWS. And we’re looking into some of the others yet so that … The Dockerization of the entire system is important for us as a milestone. So once we have it Dockerized, you can basically take it anywhere. You don’t even have to contact us.

Emrah Gultekin: It’s going to be a … So think of it this way, you do have a lot of data out there. But it’s unstructured. And our duty as people in the computer vision industry or AI and generalist is to structure that data. So the way you structure data is by seeding it through the inference engine in order to detect things. So the impact it will have on computer vision is enormous in terms of getting the models out and having different types of models. We think it is. Synthetic data is very, very important. But again, it’s a tool. It’s not the end all in this. So we don’t want to overemphasize something. It is an important tool but it is part of a larger thing that’s going on in computer vision. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Is the background combined with data and synthesized? I’m not quite sure I understand the question there. Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. I think I do but maybe I’m wrong. So in 3D synthetic data, you have the object file, the CAD file, the material file, MTL and then you choose a background as well. So you choose the background images. It could be an already generated theme on the system that we have or it could be your own theme. So it is synthesizing randomize with those backgrounds. So the background is not synthesized. The background is what you put into the system. So you might have like 2000 images of background of your warehouse and that’s where you’re going to be placing those different objects. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay. The last question in Q&A and then we’ll move over to the chat. Can you please explain using randomization for synthetic data generation? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. So in terms of randomization, you have different tools here that you are able to … There are toggle switches basically. So if you’re a power user, you can randomize the way you want and basically, place things in the places you want or you just use general randomization. And it’s on a randomization principle, where you can basically just let the machine randomize what it’s doing. But what’s important here is if you are a power user, you want to be able to control that randomization. And so you have those toggle switches in advanced settings to do that. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Emrah, are there any particular verticals that … E.g manufacturing where you see more adoption of synthetic data? Emrah Gultekin: Honestly, the clients don’t care about the use of synthetic data or real data, or what type of data you’re generating. What they really care about is how the model performs out of the box, how the model performs in their environment. So what we’re seeing more and more though is that the synthetic data is being used more in certain verticals where', 'timestamp': '2023-10-03T15:30:00Z', 'websiteAddress': 'www.chooch.com'}, {'key': 'https://www.ai21.com/blog/summarizing-legal-documents-for-different-personas-using-ai21-studio_chunk_9', 'pageURL': 'https://www.ai21.com/blog/summarizing-legal-documents-for-different-personas-using-ai21-studio', 'text': \"this question (see example). moreover, the user canâ\\x80\\x99t know the process leading to the answers, hence is unable to trust them. jurassic-x can decompose such problems into the basic questions, route each to the relevant expert, and put together an answer in free language. importantly, jurassic-x not only provides the correct answer but also displays the steps taken to reach it, increasing the trust in the system. do more people live in tel aviv or in berlin?

So in this case, we already have a device created and we’re running on a T4 GPU. And when we come in, we can now apply different streams. So adding a stream is fairly simple, you’d hit add stream, give it a name, and let’s call this… Airport runway, and then you would give it an IP. We’ll just give it a blank IP here, and we’ll hit add string. So now this new stream data has been added. And then you can go into this stream and apply a model. So if we go into one, like our smart loading example, we already have a forklift custom model built, but if we wanted to, we can add additional models to it, so we’re not limiting you on the amount of models that you can add per stream. So let’s see what this actually looks like. So this new screen I just came into is our edge dashboard. This edge capability can be in your private cloud, it can be on premise, or you can also leverage our cloud as well.

So now we can additionally group person and forklift together. So you can create a group like we have done here, and then we can go to our zones tab. So these are all like Peter was mentioning earlier, we can annotate different zones. So in this case, on our zone map, you can see we have an unloading zone and then we have a loading zone. So once you use, and it’s the same tooling that you saw before for doing the annotation, it’s just a no-code approach. We can then go to rules. So in this rule, we have defined danger zone. So it’s a person, forklift, and the unloading zone together for more than one second, then we will generate an alert. So if we go back to our devices, what users can additionally do is be alerted either in real time, or select a different frequency.

Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay. Well, thank you everyone for your questions. Oops, there’s one more. Hi, in my experience, that question about domain adaptation, isn’t it a sub discipline of machine learning which deals with scenarios in which a model train on a source distribution is used in the context of a different but related target distribution? Emrah Gultekin: Right, okay, so you’re talking about the domain in that sense? Yeah. If the domain is changing and you have … Let’s say the views are changing, the domain is changing, usually you need to tweak the model. And that’s part of the process of creating a dynamic user feedback for a grift. That’s really what this is about. So if you go back to the earlier slides where you’re getting new user feedback with annotated or with just raw images or video streams, with a change in domain, you’ve put that into shadow data sets which are checked by humans and checked by a machine. And then either you retrain the model, or you create a new model if the domain is very, very different. So there are few layers that are going on to trigger different models, depending on the scene and on the domain. Jeffrey Goldsmith: So second last question. If anybody has anything else, please post it now. So what kind of support do you have for transfer learning? Transfer- Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. So the whole system is based on transfer learning actually, that’s how we’ve generated these models and these classifications as well. So it’s based on transfer learning from a base data set that we’ve trained initially, and we keep retraining that as well. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, great. Well, I think we are done here. Thanks for the talk. Can you share the recording with us? Absolutely, I can share the recording with you. It’ll be on the blog tomorrow. You’ll get notified by Zoom. Look for a link on the LinkedIn invite for the event and we’ll post it there. Emrah, thanks for the presentation. It was really well done. And thanks to the team for all your hard work putting together this technology. Please get in touch with us if you want any one on one support. And we’ll talk to y’all soon.

And then we have things like smart annotation, so that’s going through and automatically labeling a lot of these. So if you already have, let’s say 30 aircrafts, you can go through smart annotation and be able to automatically let the system annotate all those aircrafts for you. And then the last thing is I call it the knockout punch, is using augmentation. What augmentation will do, it’ll take all those images and then apply either rotational or horizontal flips, then start adding additional, basically shifting scaling rotation, noise, blur, and brightness, and contrast to the images that are being generated, to allow for different environmental considerations. Now, just to show you what our annotation tool looks like, I’ll go into this image real quick… And here you can see this is going to be a no-code approach to labeling and annotating. So all we’re doing is taking this tool and actually drawing our bounding box around this aircraft. So we can just click drag and draw, and then we can label it as a 747, and once we hit save, you’ll see this number actually increase. Now we have 1,772 images , as well as annotations. And just to give you an idea of what the 2D synthetic looks like, so this aircraft is labeled and facing the left. Now, if I go to the next image, you’ll see the same aircraft is just resized facing the opposite direction with a different background now applied to it. So these are the ways and methods that we’re able to now generate larger amounts of data, so you can create a strong model. Now, once your data is annotated and ready to go, what you can do is just hit, create model, give it a name and then hit create. And once we hit create, Chooch is going to take this internally and start running through and building a model for us. So now what we can do is once we have these models developed and they’re built in-house with your annotations and your maybe data scientists applying their knowledge into it… And again, this can be anything from detecting objects or detecting anything from, let’s say, cancer or bacteria cells on X-ray visions. So it’s basically taking the expertise of an individual, like a doctor, and applying it to the AI. And once we build the model, then you can go to your devices.

This approach advocates performing as much computation as possible on edge devices situated near data sources, as opposed to relying heavily on distant cloud servers. Edge computing is a hot trend that is reshaping the standard topology of distributed systems. Current state of e dge computing The 2023 Gartner Hype Cycle for Edge Computing offers a deep dive into the ongoing innovations in this sphere. It delineates the high-impact developments and those on a slower trajectory to maturity. A notable prediction is the transformative role of Edge Computer Vision in businesses in the next 2 to 5 years. Despite being in its nascent stage, with a 5-20% market adoption, it holds a promising future, warranting continuous evaluation and exploration. Let’s explore the role edge computer vision applications play in edge computing, its important, business drivers and benefits of adoption, and obstacles for implementation. And see why Gartner recognized Chooch as a sample vendor for edge computer vision alongside some of the largest players in the industry. Understanding edge computing and edge computer vision Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data closer to its source or at the “edge” of a network, rather than sending all data to a centralized cloud server or data center for processing. Edge computer vision, on the other hand, is a specific application of computer vision technology that entails deploying computer vision algorithms and performing visual perception tasks, such as object detection, image recognition, and video analytics, at the edge of a network or on edge devices, like cameras and drones. This provides localized analysis and decision-making, bypassing the need for constant connectivity to central servers or cloud infras tructure . Edge computer vision applications promises quicker responses, heightened data privacy, and optimized system performance. Significance of edge computing Video and image usage has grown significantly from simple surveillance and monitoring to operational tasks. As computer vision finds increasing applications in various sectors, including employee safety and security, surveillance, manufacturing QA systems, and retail loss prevention, the necessity for swift data analysis grows. Businesses now require real-time responses to critical events. Edge computing and edge AI computer vision systems meet this demand, allowing for automated, timely analysis at the point of data capture. For example, advanced applications like object recognition and anomaly detection in manufacturing and smart check-out in retail are driving the need for more advanced and improved edge computer vision systems. D eploying edge computing : Benefits and challenges The deployment of edge computing and edge computer vision systems is set to escalate with the advent of techniques addressing hardware constraints and data availability issues.

Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, so let’s move to the chat here. First question is, is it a web service? And the answer is yes. If you go to Chooch.ai, go up to the upper right corner of the screen and sign up and you’ll see our web service right there. The second question, OpenVINO needs pre-trained models, correct? So perhaps your solution is more adequate for TensorFlow training. Does that make sense? Look at the chat. Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. Okay. The backend of this is PyTorch, Balloon, TensorFlow, TensorRT for the compression and so forth. These deep learning frameworks, some of them perform better in different environments. So it’s always an ensemble on our system. But TensorFlow is definitely one of them. So we do use TensorFlow for some of the image classification. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Another question from the same attendee, your platform is only used to generate training data sets and annotations or do you put together object AI recognition applications too? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah. That’s a good question. So our core is actually the inferencing. So the models arc is our core. These are only tools to beef up the data set in order to make the model better. So, that’s really what this is about. But the core is the model. So you just click create model, and you click the data set that you’ve generated and it’ll just generate that model, and then you can test the model on the same system. Jeffrey Goldsmith: And we’re almost done with the questions here and we’re 10 minutes before the top of the hour. Does your system handle domain adaptation? Domain adaptation. Do you see that question, Emrah? Emrah Gultekin: Yeah, I don’t understand the question. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Yeah. Matthew, could you rephrase that potentially, if you’re still on the call and we’ll answer that in a moment. How much accuracy increased going from 2D to 3D synthetic? Emrah Gultekin: So we can say, in general, depending on how much data you have, from real data manual data, which you might have 100 images of and then you create 2D let’s say with augmentation, 1000 images, you’re going from 50% accuracy to about 90% on average. But it really depends on the use case. From 2D to 3D, there’s no comparison because it’s a different thing. 3D synthetic data is very, very different. So we don’t have metrics on that. But from going from real data to any type of synthetic with augmentation, you’re basically reducing the accuracy by leaps and bounds. Jeffrey Goldsmith: Okay, looks like this our last question. Usually, 2D image, object detection is feasible. What about 3D image object recognition? Where are we on that? Emrah Gultekin: We don’t do 3D object detection or recognition. It’s 2D. And the reason is because the market … All the sensors are 2D, all the cameras are … It’s an important question and we see a future on that.

Another question regarding the private cloud, can you be installed on my private cloud? Peter: I’ll take that one as well. Our solution is very flexible in that it can be deployed a hundred percent in the cloud, or there could be also what we call the edge component OnPrem, but the edge component can also deployed in your cloud as well, so we’re very dynamic to what can deployed and where it is. We can try and explore that further based on exactly what would be the required compute and things like that. Andrew: Exactly. Thanks Peter. This one’s regarding alerts. Funny timing, right after you Peter, does our platform have the ability to send out SMS alerts, not just email alerts? Peter: Yep, and I’ll grab that one as well. So in addition to email and SMS, be it reports or alerts, we do support MQTT integration as well. And so that’s a standard within the IoT or OnPrem interface and industry, so we can integrate to an MQTT broker and then provide our predictions via JSON or things like that. Thank you. Andrew: Awesome, thanks Peter. Another one that we have here is how many public models does Chooch currently have available to customers? So I can kind of tag this one, we have over 250,000 models and it really comes down to, with our team, with the rapid model development. That’s how we have come to this number. I think we got time for maybe a couple more here as we keep going through here. Oh, someone’s done their homework. You did not mention anything about the IC2 app. Can you talk a little bit more about the IC2 app and how it connects with public models? Peter: One minor correction to what you just said, Andrew, it actually classifications or annotations. So that means, hey, we’re able to look for smoke, car, wave, boat, et cetera, but we have upwards about 80 different models, varying from image, object detection, facial detection, and also text detection. We have up to 250,000 different type of classes for those detections. Going to your second question there, Andrew, thank you for that in regards to IC2. So the IC2 mobile app, be it for Android or Apple is a way to demonstrate and test out our general deep detection, analytic, or model we have in our solution.

Techniques such as histogram equalization, gamma correction, SIFT, SURF, RPCA, and the use of CNNs, GNNs, and semi-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, along with data augmentation strategies, have all been instrumental in overcoming these challenges. Continued investment in research, development, and training of the next generation of computer vision scientists is vital for the field’s evolution. As computer vision advances, it will play an increasingly important role in driving efficiency and innovation in many sectors of the economy and society. Despite the challenges faced, the future of computer vision technology remains promising, with immense potential to reshape our world. Computer vision platforms of tomorrow The most recent wave of generative AI technologies will prove instrumental in shaping the next iterations of computer vision solutions. Today’s computer vision platforms use AI to detect events, objects, and actions that neural networks have been trained to identify, but tomorrow’s platforms may use AI to speculate the outcome of events, objects’ state or positions, and the results of actions before they occur. The true challenge of today’s AI-powered vision-based systems is their narrow understanding. For a model to “know” how to spot more objects, it must be familiar with those things. More knowledge means more training and heavier models. Our society is on the precipice of general AI, which will provide always-on, hyper-intelligent, digital assistants to tomorrow’s enterprises. Such assistants will not just know how to detect things it knows, but they will know how to learn and how to communicate what they see.

So again, it’s a way to test out and demonstrate the power of our product. Omid: I just wanted to add to that with the IC2 , we’re constantly developing and iterating on it. And now what we’re also able to do is annotate on the fly. So you could be out in the field somewhere and you need to make an annotation. You can grab an image of it, annotate it, and it’ll actually get pushed up to your cloud dataset. So in your dataset, you’ll have an actual tag there for your IC2 app , and then all the images that you annotate on your phone through the IC2 app will get generated there, so you can incorporate that into your larger datasets. Andrew: Absolutely. And thanks Peter, for the clarification on that one. We got time for one more question here. Does Chooch AI offer pilots to companies, and how long is a typical pilot? We can kind of tag team this one. A pilot or a kickstart can vary anywhere from weeks to months, but the short answer is yes, we do offer that, and would love to talk to you more about how this works with you and scope this process with you. Absolutely, we do. Any team members have anything else to add on that? Peter: Yeah, and I’ll jump in there as well. And again, the pilot is dependent upon the use case, the model to be developed, and just also how ROI or return on investment is measured on that. But ultimately it’s on a case by case basis, and within the timeframe kind of what Andrew budgeted there. Andrew: Absolutely. Well, we are our running short of time here. We try to get to all the questions. Those that we did not, we’ll try to get back to you via this chat. Thank you all for joining today, and please feel to reach out to us at chooch.ai, and we look forward to communicating with you and answering more of your questions. Thanks so much for joining us today, have a great rest of your day. Peter: Thank you very much, everyone. Share Featured Articles Edge AI When is the Right Time to Deploy Edge Computing?
