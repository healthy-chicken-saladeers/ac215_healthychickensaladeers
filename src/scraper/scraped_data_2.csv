That’s why our products and services are inclusive by design, with built-in accessibility features to help you connect, create, and do what you love — in the ways that work best for you. Vision Bigger, bolder, and clearer for you . Magnifier + Point and Speak Point to hear your way around. Reheat REHEAT Read more about Magnifier + Point and Speak Magnifier + Point and Speak Magnifier works like a digital magnifying glass, using the camera on your iPhone or iPad to increase the size of anything you point it at — from a prescription bottle to a candlelit menu. For those who are blind or have low vision and want more information about their physical surroundings, Detection Mode in Magnifier combines input from the camera, LiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine learning to offer intelligent tools like People Detection, Door Detection, Image Descriptions, Text Detection, and Point and Speak. 1 If you’re standing in line, you can use People Detection to determine a person’s proximity to you. Door Detection can help you navigate by identifying doors, text, and the presence of symbols — such as a restroom symbol, a no smoking symbol, or an accessible-entrance symbol — within a few feet of you. Image Descriptions and Text Detection let you hear more about people, objects, landscapes, and text in your camera’s field of view. And Point and Speak makes it easier to interact with physical objects that have text, like household appliances, keypads, or labels on files. As you point and move your finger over or under different buttons or elements, your iPhone or iPad reads the text out loud, so you can perform everyday activities and tasks with more ease and independence. 2 Point to hear your way around.
